# Epic 2 Plan Flaws Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Context**: Story 2.2 AC3 failure (38% vs 56% baseline) prompted re-evaluation of Epic 2 strategy

---

## The Original Epic 2 Plan

From `docs/prd/epic-2-advanced-rag-enhancements.md`:

### Story 2.2: Phase 2B - Element-Based Chunking Enhancement
- **Target Accuracy**: 56% → 64-68% (+8-12pp conservative estimate)
- **Rationale**: "Respect element boundaries for semantic coherence"
- **Status**: ✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION (Priority: HIGH)

### GraphRAG Stories
- **Status**: ⚠️ ARCHIVED (Pre-Pivot Approach - Phase 3+ Only)
- **Rationale**: "Deferred due to complexity, element-aware expected to reach 64-68%"

---

## Identified Flaws

### Flaw 1: No Empirical Evidence for Element-Aware Chunking

**What the Plan Assumed**:
> "Element-based chunking will improve accuracy by 8-12 percentage points"

**What Research Actually Shows**:
- Yepes et al.: Element-based "Keywords Chipper" = **46.10% accuracy**
- Yepes et al.: Fixed 512-token chunking = **68.09% accuracy**
- Element-aware chunking UNDERPERFORMS fixed chunking by **22 percentage points**

**The Mistake**: Plan relied on theoretical benefits without consulting benchmarks.

---

### Flaw 2: GraphRAG Dismissed Without Evaluation

**What the Plan Assumed**:
> "GraphRAG is overkill for simple retrieval, defer to Phase 3+"

**What Evidence Actually Shows**:
- **FalkorDB Benchmark**: Vector RAG = 0% on schema-bound queries, GraphRAG = 90%+
- **BNP Paribas Study**: GraphRAG achieves 0.937 faithfulness on FinanceBench (vs 0.844 text RAG)
- **AWS Production**: GraphRAG deployed for fraud detection across Excel tables
- **Performance Gain**: 3.4x improvement (56.2% → 90%+)

**The Mistake**: GraphRAG dismissed as "complex" without considering empirical evidence showing 90%+ accuracy on financial documents.

---

### Flaw 3: Misread Research Recommendations

**What We Thought Yepes et al. Said**:
> "Use element boundaries (tables, sections, paragraphs) to chunk documents"

**What Yepes et al. Actually Said**:
> "Pure element-based chunking achieved only 46.10% accuracy. **Uniform 512-token split achieved 68.09%**—largely because some keyword-derived segments were too brief or lacked sufficient global metadata."

**The Mistake**: Confused "respect element metadata" with "chunk by element boundaries."

**Correct Interpretation**: Use FIXED chunks but ADD element-type metadata to each chunk.

---

### Flaw 4: Ignored Data Profile Alignment

**Our Document Profile**:
- 160 pages, 48% tables (HEAVY table content)
- Multi-hop queries (Cash flow → Capex → Working Capital)
- Schema-intensive (KPIs across entities and time periods)
- Precision queries ("Portugal Aug-25 variable cost per ton")

**GraphRAG Ideal Use Case** (from FalkorDB benchmark):
- Schema-intensive queries (KPIs, forecasts, relationships)
- Multi-hop traversal required
- Entity relationship modeling critical
- **EXACT MATCH to our profile**

**The Mistake**: Dismissed GraphRAG without recognizing our data matches its ideal use case.

---

### Flaw 5: Conservative Target Without Ceiling Analysis

**Plan Target**: 64-68% accuracy

**What Research Shows is Achievable**:
- GraphRAG: **90%+** (FalkorDB, BNP Paribas)
- Structured Multi-Index: **92.51% chunk recall** (FinSage on FinanceBench)
- TableRAG: **84.62%** (Microsoft Research on table-heavy data)

**The Mistake**: Set conservative targets without investigating upper bound of performance.

**Impact**: If we'd known 90%+ was achievable, we'd never have tried element-aware chunking.

---

## Root Cause: Lack of Benchmark-Driven Planning

### What the Plan Was Based On:
1. ❌ Theoretical benefits of semantic boundaries
2. ❌ Assumptions about complexity vs value tradeoffs
3. ❌ Conservative estimates without upper bound research
4. ❌ Anecdotal evidence from blog posts

### What the Plan Should Have Been Based On:
1. ✅ Empirical benchmarks (FinanceBench, FalkorDB, HybridQA)
2. ✅ Production system results (FinSage, AWS, BNP Paribas)
3. ✅ Data profile matching (our 48% tables → table-heavy benchmarks)
4. ✅ Proven accuracy ceilings (what's actually achievable)

---

## Corrective Actions

### Immediate:
1. ✅ **Abandon element-aware chunking** (AC3 38% = catastrophic failure)
2. ⏳ **Re-evaluate GraphRAG** with empirical evidence (90%+ proven)
3. ⏳ **Consider Structured Multi-Index** (FinSage: 92.51% recall on FinanceBench)

### Strategic:
1. **Benchmark-driven planning**: Consult FinanceBench results BEFORE choosing approaches
2. **Data profile matching**: Compare our docs (48% tables) to benchmark datasets
3. **Production validation**: Prioritize approaches with real deployments (AWS, BNP Paribas, FinSage)
4. **Upper bound research**: Always investigate "what's the best achievable?" before setting targets

## Revised Epic 2 Approach

### Original Plan:
```
Story 2.2: Element-aware chunking (target: 64-68%)
→ GraphRAG deferred to Phase 3+
```

### Evidence-Based Plan:
```
Story 2.2A: Structured Multi-Index (FinSage architecture)
- Target: 70-80% accuracy (conservative based on 92.51% chunk recall)
- Timeline: 3-4 weeks
- Risk: Medium (production proven on FinanceBench)

Story 2.2B: GraphRAG (Epic 2 activation) - IF multi-hop queries critical
- Target: 90%+ accuracy (proven in FalkorDB + BNP Paribas)
- Timeline: 3-4 weeks
- Risk: Medium-High (infrastructure complexity)

Fallback: Fixed Chunking + Metadata
- Target: 68-72% (Yepes et al. proven)
- Timeline: 1-2 weeks
- Risk: Low (simple implementation)
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Empirical > Theoretical**: Always consult benchmarks before implementation
2. **Production > Research Prototypes**: Prioritize approaches deployed in real systems
3. **Data Matching > Generic Advice**: Our 48% tables → table-heavy benchmarks
4. **Upper Bounds Matter**: Knowing 90%+ is achievable changes strategy entirely
5. **Benchmark Datasets**: FinanceBench exists for exactly our use case - use it!

---

**Conclusion**: Epic 2 plan was flawed due to lack of benchmark-driven planning. Element-aware chunking was doomed from the start (research showed 46.10%). GraphRAG should have been evaluated first (90%+ proven). Corrective action: Implement Structured Multi-Index OR activate GraphRAG based on PM decision.
