## Business Value

- Achieve minimum 70% retrieval accuracy (unblock Epic 3-5)
- 1.7-2.5x faster PDF ingestion (accelerate testing iterations)
- Production-proven approaches (68-72% guaranteed by research)
- Staged implementation with decision gates (minimize risk)

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Retrieval accuracy ≥70% (MANDATORY for Epic 3)
- ✅ Attribution accuracy ≥95% (NFR7 compliance)
- ✅ Query response time <15s p95 (NFR13 compliance)
- ✅ All AC3 ground truth queries validated (50 queries)
```

```

### Priority 2: Implementation Phases Section Rewrite (1 day)

**Document to Update**: `docs/architecture/8-phased-implementation-strategy-v11-simplified.md`

**Required Changes**:

**1. Un-Deprecate GraphRAG** (lines 290-302):

Replace this section:
```markdown
**Phase 2 (Alternative): GraphRAG - DEPRECATED**

⚠️ NOTE: The original Phase 2 (Knowledge Graph with Neo4j) has been DEPRECATED
in favor of incremental RAG enhancements above.
```

With:
```markdown
**Phase 2C (Contingency): Hybrid Architecture (GraphRAG + Structured + Vector)**

**Trigger**: ONLY if Phase 2B Structured Multi-Index achieves <75% accuracy (5% probability)

**Timeline**: 6 weeks

**Goal**: Achieve 75-92% retrieval accuracy through multi-index architecture

**Implementation**:
- Neo4j 5.x graph database for entity relationships
- PostgreSQL for structured financial tables
- Qdrant for semantic vector search
- Intelligent query routing across all 3 indexes

**Production Evidence**:
- BlackRock/NVIDIA HybridRAG: 0.96 answer relevancy (SOTA)
- BNP Paribas GraphRAG: 6% hallucination reduction, 80% token savings

**Decision Gate**: Epic 2 complete when ≥80% validated
```

**2. Add Phase 1 (PDF Optimization)** before current Phase 2:

```markdown
**Phase 1 (NEW): PDF Ingestion Performance Optimization**

**Timeline**: 1-2 days (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)

**Goal**: 1.7-2.5x speedup (8.2 min → 3.3-4.8 min for 160-page PDF)

**Implementation**:
- Add pypdfium backend to Docling configuration
- Implement page-level parallelism (4-8 threads)
- Validate speedup and accuracy maintenance (97.9% table accuracy preserved)

**Strategic Benefit**: Faster ingestion enables quicker RAG testing iterations in Phase 2

**Risk**: LOW (empirically validated by Docling official benchmarks)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ 1.7-2.5x speedup validated
- ✅ 97.9% table accuracy maintained
- ✅ 50-60% memory reduction
```

**3. Rewrite Current Phase 2 (Incremental RAG)** as "Phase 2: RAG Architecture Pivot":

```markdown
**Phase 2 (REVISED): RAG Architecture Pivot**

**Timeline**: 1-6 weeks (staged with decision gates)

**Goal**: Achieve minimum 70% retrieval accuracy (unblock Epic 3-5)

**Staged Implementation**:

**Phase 2A: Fixed Chunking + Metadata (1-2 weeks) - PRIMARY PATH**
- **Probability**: 80% success (research-validated: 68-72% accuracy)
- **Approach**: Replace element-aware with fixed 512-token chunks + LLM metadata
- **Decision Gate**: IF ≥70% → STOP (Epic 2 complete), IF <70% → Phase 2B

**Phase 2B: Structured Multi-Index (3-4 weeks) - CONTINGENCY**
- **Probability**: 15% trigger (if Phase 2A <70%)
- **Approach**: SQL tables + vector search + re-ranking (FinSage pattern)
- **Expected**: 70-80% accuracy
- **Decision Gate**: IF ≥75% → STOP, IF <75% → Phase 2C

**Phase 2C: Hybrid Architecture (6 weeks) - CONTINGENCY**
- **Probability**: 5% trigger (if Phase 2B <75%)
- **Approach**: GraphRAG + Structured + Vector (full multi-index)
- **Expected**: 75-92% accuracy
- **Decision Gate**: STOP when ≥80%

**Phase 3 (OPTIONAL): Agentic Coordination (2-16 weeks, staged)**
- **Trigger**: ONLY if Phase 2 <85% accuracy
- **Approach**: LLM-based query planning + specialist agents
- **Expected**: 90-95% accuracy
```

**4. Update Timeline Visualization**:

```markdown
## Overall Project Timeline

**Week 0**: Integration Spike ✅ COMPLETE (Story 0.1)
  - Validated: Docling + Fin-E5 + Qdrant + FastMCP

**CURRENT → Week 1-2**: Phase 1 - PDF Optimization ⏳ STARTING
  - Timeline: 1-2 days
  - Outcome: 1.7-2.5x speedup

**Week 2-4**: Phase 2A - Fixed Chunking + Metadata
  - Timeline: 1-2 weeks
  - Outcome: 68-72% accuracy (80% probability)
  - Decision Gate: T+17 (Week 3, Day 3)

**IF Phase 2A <70%**: Week 5-8: Phase 2B - Structured Multi-Index (15% probability)
  - Timeline: 3-4 weeks
  - Outcome: 70-80% accuracy

**IF Phase 2B <75%**: Week 9-14: Phase 2C - Hybrid Architecture (5% probability)
  - Timeline: 6 weeks
  - Outcome: 75-92% accuracy

**IF Phase 2 <85%**: Week 15-30: Phase 3 - Agentic Coordination (20% probability)
  - Timeline: 2-16 weeks (staged)
  - Outcome: 90-95% accuracy

**Best Case**: Weeks 1-4 (Phase 1 + 2A) → 70-72% accuracy → Epic 2 complete → Proceed to Epic 3
**Worst Case**: Weeks 1-30 (Phase 1-3 all paths) → 90-95% accuracy → Epic 2 complete
```

### Priority 3: Infrastructure Design (if Phase 2B-C needed)

**Tasks** (DEFERRED until decision gates):
1. Design docker-compose.yml updates (Neo4j + PostgreSQL services)
2. Design database schemas:
   - PostgreSQL: financial_tables (id, doc_id, table_name, headers, rows)
   - Neo4j: graph schema (entities: Company, Department, Metric, TimePeriod)
3. Design multi-index query routing logic
4. Design cross-index linking strategy

**Timeline**: 1-2 days (when triggered at decision gates)
