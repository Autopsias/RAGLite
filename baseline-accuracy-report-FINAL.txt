============================================================

Date: 2025-10-16
Story: Story 1.15B - Baseline Validation & Analysis
Test Duration: ~6.5 seconds (50 queries)
Test Script: scripts/run-accuracy-tests.py
Ground Truth: tests/fixtures/ground_truth.py (50 queries)

------------------------------------------------------------
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------

Baseline accuracy established with adaptive number format matching.
Results show system requires Epic 2 (Advanced RAG Enhancements) to meet NFR targets.

DECISION GATE OUTCOME: Path 3 - Implement Epic 2, Stories 2.1 → 2.2 → 2.3

------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL ACCURACY RESULTS (VALID)
------------------------------------------------------------

Total Queries:         50
Retrieval Accuracy:    56.0% (28/50 pass) ❌ Below NFR6 target (90%)
Attribution Accuracy:  32.0% (16/50 pass) ❌ Below NFR7 target (95%)
Errors:                0

Latency Metrics:
  p50 Latency:         33.20ms ✅ (target: <5000ms - 150x better)
  p95 Latency:         63.34ms ✅ (target: <15000ms - 237x better)

------------------------------------------------------------
NFR VALIDATION
------------------------------------------------------------

NFR6 (≥90% retrieval):      ✗ FAIL (56.0% - 34 percentage points below target)
NFR7 (≥95% attribution):    ✗ FAIL (32.0% - 63 percentage points below target)
NFR13 (p50 <5s):            ✓ PASS (33.20ms - 150x better than target)
NFR13 (p95 <15s):           ✓ PASS (63.34ms - 237x better than target)

Status: 2/4 NFR targets met (performance targets achieved, accuracy targets missed)

------------------------------------------------------------
CRITICAL FIX APPLIED
------------------------------------------------------------

Issue: Number Format Mismatch
  - Ground truth expects American format (23.2)
  - PDF contains European format (23,2)
  - Original result: 0% accuracy (all queries failed)

Solution: Adaptive Number Normalization
  - Added normalize_numbers() function to accuracy_utils.py
  - Normalizes both American and European formats to canonical form
  - Enables format-agnostic keyword matching
  - Result: 56% retrieval accuracy, 32% attribution accuracy (REAL baseline)

Technical Changes:
  1. Added regex-based number normalization in accuracy_utils.py:
     - European decimals (23,2) → American (23.2)
     - European thousands (104 647) → normalized (104647)
     - American formats remain unchanged
  2. Fixed pass_/pass key mismatch in calculate_performance_metrics()
  3. Applied normalization to both keywords and retrieved text

------------------------------------------------------------
ACCURACY BREAKDOWN BY QUERY TYPE
------------------------------------------------------------

Retrieval Accuracy: 56.0% (28/50 pass)
  - Passed: 28 queries successfully retrieved expected keywords
  - Failed: 22 queries did not meet 50% keyword match threshold

Attribution Accuracy: 32.0% (16/50 pass)
  - Passed: 16 queries retrieved correct page (±1 tolerance)
  - Failed: 34 queries did not retrieve expected page in top-5 results

Key Observation:
  - Retrieval accuracy (56%) is moderate - semantic search finding relevant content
  - Attribution accuracy (32%) is low - correct pages not prioritized in top-5
  - Gap between retrieval and attribution suggests ranking/relevance issue

------------------------------------------------------------
FAILURE PATTERN ANALYSIS
------------------------------------------------------------

Primary Issues Identified:

1. Page Ranking/Relevance (Attribution Failures)
   - Correct pages often not in top-5 results
   - Semantic similarity not sufficient for precise page targeting
   - Example: Query expects page 46, retrieves pages 93, 62, 132, 153, 49
   - Impact: 34/50 queries (68%) have attribution failures

2. Keyword Coverage (Retrieval Failures)
   - Some queries have insufficient keyword matches (<50% threshold)
   - Domain-specific terminology may not be captured in embeddings
   - Example: "alternative fuel rate percentage" - only 1/4 keywords matched
   - Impact: 22/50 queries (44%) have retrieval failures

3. Generality of Queries
   - Some queries too generic (e.g., "packaging costs per ton")
   - Match multiple pages with similar content
   - Semantic search retrieves relevant but not exact pages

------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION GATE EXECUTION
------------------------------------------------------------

Criteria Evaluation:

**Path 1:** Retrieval ≥90% AND Attribution ≥95% → Skip Epic 2
  ❌ NOT MET (Retrieval: 56%, Attribution: 32%)

**Path 2:** Retrieval 85-89% OR Attribution 93-94% → Epic 2, Story 2.1 only
  ❌ NOT MET (Both metrics significantly below thresholds)

**Path 3:** Retrieval <85% OR Attribution <93% → Epic 2, Stories 2.1→2.3
  ✅ MET (Retrieval: 56% << 85%, Attribution: 32% << 93%)

**DECISION:** Path 3 - Implement FULL Epic 2 (Advanced RAG Enhancements)

Required Stories:
  - Story 2.1: Hybrid Search (BM25 + Semantic) - HIGH PRIORITY
  - Story 2.2: Financial Domain Embeddings (Fin-BERT) - HIGH PRIORITY
  - Story 2.3: Table-Aware Chunking - MEDIUM PRIORITY
  - Story 2.4: LLM Synthesis (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
  - Story 2.5: Query Expansion - LOW PRIORITY

Expected Impact:
  - Story 2.1 (Hybrid Search): +15-20% retrieval accuracy
  - Story 2.2 (Financial Embeddings): +10-15% retrieval accuracy
  - Story 2.3 (Table-Aware Chunking): +5-10% attribution accuracy
  - Combined target: 85-90% retrieval, 65-75% attribution after Epic 2

------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 2 RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------

Priority 1: Story 2.1 - Hybrid Search (BM25 + Semantic)
  Rationale: Address page ranking/relevance issues
  Expected Improvement: +15-20% retrieval, +10-15% attribution
  Risk: Low (proven technique, minimal latency impact)

Priority 2: Story 2.2 - Financial Domain Embeddings
  Rationale: Improve semantic understanding of financial terminology
  Expected Improvement: +10-15% retrieval, +5-10% attribution
  Risk: Low (drop-in replacement for Fin-E5)

Priority 3: Story 2.3 - Table-Aware Chunking
  Rationale: Preserve table structure for better attribution
  Expected Improvement: +5-10% attribution
  Risk: Low (preprocessing, no query-time impact)

Priority 4: Story 2.4 - LLM Synthesis
  Rationale: Improve answer quality and citation accuracy
  Expected Improvement: +10-15% attribution (better citation generation)
  Risk: Medium (significant latency increase, 2-5s per query)

Priority 5: Story 2.5 - Query Expansion
  Rationale: Improve keyword coverage for domain-specific queries
  Expected Improvement: +5-10% retrieval
  Risk: Low (minimal latency impact)

Implementation Sequence:
  1. Stories 2.1 + 2.2 in parallel (independent, both high priority)
  2. Re-validate after 2.1 + 2.2 (expect 80-85% retrieval)
  3. Story 2.3 (if attribution still <70%)
  4. Story 2.4 (if attribution still <75%)
  5. Story 2.5 (if retrieval still <90%)

------------------------------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE BASELINE (EXCELLENT)
------------------------------------------------------------

Query Latency:
  p50: 33.20ms ✅ (150x better than 5s target)
  p95: 63.34ms ✅ (237x better than 15s target)

Performance Budget:
  Current baseline: 63.34ms (p95)
  NFR13 target: 15,000ms (p95)
  Available for Epic 2: 14,936.66ms (99.6% of budget remaining)

Epic 2 Latency Budget:
  - Story 2.1 (Hybrid Search): ~100-200ms
  - Story 2.2 (Financial Embeddings): ~0ms (drop-in)
  - Story 2.3 (Table-Aware Chunking): ~0ms (preprocessing)
  - Story 2.4 (LLM Synthesis): ~2000-5000ms
  - Story 2.5 (Query Expansion): ~50-100ms
  - Total estimated: ~5250ms (p95)
  - Final expected latency: ~5313ms (still 2.8x better than target)

Conclusion: Sufficient latency budget for ALL Epic 2 enhancements

------------------------------------------------------------
SYSTEM ASSESSMENT
------------------------------------------------------------

What's Working ✅:
  1. Ingestion: 321 chunks, pages 1-160, table data preserved
  2. Semantic Search: Retrieving relevant content (56% accuracy)
  3. Performance: Excellent (33ms p50, 63ms p95)
  4. Stability: Zero errors during 50-query test
  5. Number Format Handling: Adaptive checker works for both formats

What Needs Improvement ❌:
  1. Page Ranking: Correct pages not prioritized in top-5 (32% attribution)
  2. Keyword Coverage: Domain-specific terminology gaps (56% retrieval)
  3. Semantic Relevance: Not sufficient for precise page targeting

Root Cause:
  - Single-stage semantic search insufficient for financial domain
  - Embedding model (Fin-E5) not optimized for financial reports
  - No hybrid search to complement semantic with keyword matching

------------------------------------------------------------
RISKS & MITIGATION
------------------------------------------------------------

Risk 1: Epic 2 insufficient to reach 90% retrieval
  Likelihood: MEDIUM
  Impact: HIGH (blocks Epic 1 completion)
  Mitigation:
    - Implement Stories 2.1-2.3 first, measure incrementally
    - If still <85% after Epic 2, escalate to architecture review
    - Consider additional enhancements (reranking, query understanding)

Risk 2: Ground truth quality issues
  Likelihood: LOW
  Impact: MEDIUM (accuracy measurements unreliable)
  Mitigation:
    - Ground truth validated in Story 1.14
    - Adaptive number formatting resolves format mismatches
    - Re-validate ground truth if accuracy remains low after Epic 2

Risk 3: Latency budget exceeded by LLM synthesis
  Likelihood: LOW
  Impact: MEDIUM (NFR13 violation)
  Mitigation:
    - Monitor latency after each story implementation
    - Use streaming responses for LLM synthesis
    - Client-side timeout handling
    - Skip Story 2.4 if p95 approaches 10s

------------------------------------------------------------
LESSONS LEARNED
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Number Format Handling
   - PDFs may use different regional number formats
   - Always implement format-agnostic comparison for numeric data
   - Regex-based normalization is effective for both American and European formats

2. Ground Truth Validation
   - Keyword existence verification is critical during ground truth creation
   - Format assumptions (American vs European) should be explicit
   - Validation should include actual keyword matching tests

3. Baseline Establishment
   - Early baseline validation reveals actual system performance
   - Adaptive solutions (like number normalization) better than manual fixes
   - Decision gates based on real data prevent over/under-engineering

------------------------------------------------------------
