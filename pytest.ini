# Performance & Execution Options
# NOTE: Parallel execution enabled by default for faster test runs
#   - Unit tests run in parallel across all workers
#   - Integration tests run in single worker (grouped via xdist_group in conftest.py)
#   - This prevents Qdrant collection race conditions
# NOTE: Coverage is NOT in addopts to fix VSCode Test Explorer compatibility
# Add --cov=raglite manually or use Makefile commands for coverage reports
# NOTE: Slow tests (20+ min) are skipped by default using @pytest.mark.skipif
# To run slow tests explicitly: pytest --run-slow

    # Parallel execution DISABLED to prevent flaky tests from shared Qdrant state
    # Parallel execution (-n 2) causes random failures due to race conditions
    # Sequential execution guarantees 100% reliable results (trade: slower by ~3-5min)
    # To re-enable parallel execution: change -n 0 to -n 2
    -n 0
    # Automatic retry for flaky tests (pytest-rerunfailures)
    # Retries failed tests up to 3 times with 2s delay between attempts
    # This eliminates intermittent failures from parallel execution race conditions
    # Increased from 2→3 retries and 1s→2s delay for Qdrant state stabilization
