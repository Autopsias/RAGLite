# Test Speed Optimization Guide

**Goal:** Reduce test execution time from 10-15 minutes to <5 minutes for daily development

---

## Quick Start - Optimized Workflows

### 🏃 Ultra-Fast Workflow (30 seconds)

**Use case:** On every save, before committing

```bash
# Run smoke tests only (critical path)
pytest -m smoke -v

# Expected: <30 seconds for 15-20 critical tests
```

---

### ⚡ Fast Feedback Loop (2 minutes)

**Use case:** After making changes, before running integration tests

```bash
# Run unit tests with parallel execution
pytest tests/unit -n auto -v

# Expected: <2 minutes for 130 unit tests
# Parallel speedup: 4-8x faster (2 min → 15-30 seconds on 8-core machine)
```

---

### 🎯 Pre-Commit Validation (5 minutes)

**Use case:** Before pushing to remote, comprehensive validation

```bash
# Run smoke + unit + fast integration tests
pytest -m "smoke or unit" tests/unit tests/integration -m "not slow" -v

# Expected: ~5 minutes total
# Breakdown:
#   - Smoke: 30s
#   - Unit: 2 min
#   - Integration (fast): 2-3 min
```

---

### 🔬 Full Suite (15-20 minutes)

**Use case:** CI/CD, before PR merge, comprehensive validation

```bash
# Run everything including slow tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Expected: 15-20 minutes
# This is for CI/CD only, not daily development
```

---

## Performance Comparison

| Workflow | Tests Run | Time | Use Case |
|----------|-----------|------|----------|
| **Smoke** | 15-20 | <30s | Every save/commit |
| **Unit** | 130 | <2 min | After changes |
| **Unit (parallel)** | 130 | <1 min | Fast feedback |
| **Integration (fast)** | 77 | 2-5 min | Before push |
| **Full suite** | 207 | 15-20 min | CI/CD only |

## VS Code Test Explorer Optimization

### Current State (FIXED)

After applying fixes, Test Explorer now shows:
- **Unit tests:** 130 tests in `tests/unit/` folder
- **Integration tests:** 77 tests in `tests/integration/` folder
- **Total visible:** 207 tests

### Optimized Test Explorer Workflow

**Step 1: Run Unit Tests First**
```
1. Open Test Explorer (cmd+shift+T)
2. Expand "tests/unit" folder
3. Click "Run" on unit folder
4. Result: <2 min, 130 tests pass
```

**Step 2: Run Integration Tests (If Unit Tests Pass)**
```
1. Expand "tests/integration" folder
2. Right-click → "Run Tests"
3. Result: 5-10 min, 77 tests pass
```

**Step 3: Run Specific Test Files**
```
1. Click on specific test file (e.g., test_retrieval.py)
2. Click "Run"
3. Result: <10s for focused testing
```

---

## Optimization Techniques Applied

### 1. Test Discovery Fix

**Before:** Only 77 integration tests visible (10-15 min)
**After:** 207 tests visible (unit + integration)

**Fix applied:**
- Removed marker filter from `.vscode/settings.json`
- Test Explorer now discovers all tests
- User can selectively run fast unit tests first

---

### 2. Parallel Execution for Unit Tests

**Before:** 130 unit tests running sequentially (~2 min)
**After:** 130 unit tests running in parallel (~30-60s)

**How to enable:**
```bash
# Auto-detect CPU cores
pytest tests/unit -n auto

# Or specify worker count
pytest tests/unit -n 4  # 4 parallel workers
```

**Speedup:** 2-4x faster on multi-core machines

---

### 3. Smoke Test Suite

**Concept:** Mark 15-20 critical tests with `@pytest.mark.smoke`

**Example:**
```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.smoke
@pytest.mark.unit
def test_basic_configuration():
    """Smoke test: Verify config loads."""
    from raglite.shared.config import get_settings
    settings = get_settings()
    assert settings is not None

@pytest.mark.smoke
@pytest.mark.integration
async def test_basic_qdrant_connection():
    """Smoke test: Verify Qdrant connection."""
    from raglite.shared.clients import get_qdrant_client
    client = get_qdrant_client()
    assert client is not None
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run only smoke tests
pytest -m smoke

# Expected: <30 seconds for critical path validation
```

---

### 4. Integration Test Sampling

**Problem:** Some integration tests run 50+ queries (10-15 min)

**Solution:** Sample queries instead of running all

**Example - Before:**
```python
# SLOW: Runs ALL 50 ground truth queries
for idx, query in enumerate(GROUND_TRUTH_QA, start=1):  # 50 queries
    result = await hybrid_search(query["question"])
    # 50 queries × 10-15s each = 8-12 minutes for ONE test
```

**Example - After:**
```python
# FAST: Sample 5 random queries for quick validation
import random

@pytest.mark.parametrize("query_idx", random.sample(range(len(GROUND_TRUTH_QA)), 5))
async def test_ground_truth_sample(query_idx):
    """Validate ground truth accuracy with sampling."""
    query = GROUND_TRUTH_QA[query_idx]
    result = await hybrid_search(query["question"])
    # 5 queries × 10-15s each = 50-75 seconds total
```

**Speedup:** 50 queries → 5 queries = 10x faster

---

## Recommended Daily Workflow

### Morning: Start Development

```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes
git pull

# 2. Run smoke tests (30s)
pytest -m smoke

# If smoke tests pass → Start coding
```

---

### During Development: Rapid Iteration

```bash
# After making changes:

# 1. Run unit tests for affected module (10-30s)
pytest tests/unit/test_retrieval.py -v

# 2. If pass, run all unit tests (2 min)
pytest tests/unit -n auto -v

# 3. If pass, continue coding or run integration tests
```

---

### Before Commit: Validation

```bash
# 1. Run smoke + unit tests (2-3 min)
pytest -m smoke tests/unit -v

# 2. Run fast integration tests (5 min)
pytest tests/integration -m "not slow" -v

# 3. If all pass → Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "..."
git push
```

---

### Before PR: Full Validation

```bash
# Run complete test suite (15-20 min)
pytest tests/ -v --cov=raglite --cov-report=html

# Review coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html
```

---

## Performance Tuning Tips

### 1. Use Pytest Cache

```bash
# Only re-run tests that failed last time
pytest --lf -v

# Or re-run failed tests FIRST, then others
pytest --ff -v
```

**Speedup:** Instant feedback on previously failing tests

---

### 2. Run Specific Test Patterns

```bash
# Run tests matching a keyword
pytest -k "test_retrieval" -v

# Run tests in specific file
pytest tests/unit/test_retrieval.py::test_search_documents -v

# Run tests by marker
pytest -m "unit and not slow" -v
```

---

### 3. Stop on First Failure

```bash
# Stop immediately when a test fails
pytest tests/unit -x -v

# Stop after N failures
pytest tests/unit --maxfail=3 -v
```

**Speedup:** Don't waste time running remaining tests if something is broken

---

### 4. Disable Output Capture for Debugging

```bash
# Show print statements and logs immediately
pytest tests/unit -s -v

# Useful for debugging, but slower
```

---

## Integration Test Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Query Sampling

Instead of running ALL queries, sample a representative subset:

```python
# Old: Run 50 queries (10 min)
for query in GROUND_TRUTH_QA:  # 50 queries
    test_query(query)

# New: Run 5 sampled queries (1 min)
import random
sample = random.sample(GROUND_TRUTH_QA, 5)
for query in sample:
    test_query(query)
```

**Files to optimize:**
- `tests/integration/test_ac3_ground_truth.py` - Currently runs 50 queries
- `tests/integration/test_mcp_response_validation.py` - Runs 5-10 queries per test
- `tests/integration/test_e2e_query_validation.py` - Multiple query loops

---

### Strategy 2: Parametrization

Split heavy tests into smaller parametrized tests:

```python
# Old: One heavy test running 10 queries (2 min)
async def test_all_queries():
    for query in queries:  # 10 queries
        await test_query(query)

# New: 10 separate tests (can run in parallel eventually)
@pytest.mark.parametrize("query", queries)
async def test_single_query(query):
    await test_query(query)
```

**Benefits:**
- Can see which specific query failed
- Potential for parallel execution in future
- Better Test Explorer visualization

---

### Strategy 3: Lazy Fixture Loading

Defer expensive setup until actually needed:

```python
# Old: Setup runs for ALL tests (slow)
@pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
async def setup_everything():
    await expensive_setup()  # Runs even if test doesn't need it

# New: Setup only when requested
@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
async def expensive_resource():
    return await expensive_setup()

# Test explicitly requests it
async def test_something(expensive_resource):
    result = await use_resource(expensive_resource)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Unit tests still slow

**Check:**
```bash
# Time individual unit tests
pytest tests/unit -v --durations=10

# Look for unit tests taking >1 second
```

**Fix:**
- Unit tests should NOT make real API calls
- Mock expensive operations
- Check for accidental integration test behavior

---

### Issue: Integration tests hanging

**Check:**
```bash
# Run with timeout
pytest tests/integration --timeout=60 -v

# Identify which test is hanging
```

**Fix:**
- Check for infinite loops in hybrid search
- Verify Qdrant/PostgreSQL connections
- Add explicit timeouts to search operations

---

### Issue: Parallel execution causing failures

**Symptom:** Tests pass sequentially but fail with `-n auto`

**Cause:** Tests sharing state or modifying global data

**Fix:**
```bash
# Run only unit tests in parallel (safe)
pytest tests/unit -n auto

# Keep integration tests sequential (shared Qdrant)
pytest tests/integration -n 0
```

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Immediate (Apply Now)

```bash
# 1. Reload VS Code to see all tests
cmd+shift+p → "Reload Window"

# 2. Run unit tests first
pytest tests/unit -n auto -v

# 3. Verify <1 minute runtime
```

---

### 2. This Week (Mark Critical Tests)

Add `@pytest.mark.smoke` to ~15-20 critical tests:
- Basic config loading
- Qdrant connection
- PostgreSQL connection
- Simple query execution
- MCP server initialization

---

### 3. Next Sprint (Optimize Integration Tests)

Apply query sampling to heavy integration tests:
- `test_ac3_ground_truth.py` - Sample 5 of 50 queries
- `test_mcp_response_validation.py` - Sample 3 of 10 queries
- Create separate "comprehensive" tests for CI/CD

---

## Conclusion

**Before optimizations:**
- 77 tests visible (130 unit tests hidden)
- 10-15 minute runtime
- No fast feedback loop

**After optimizations:**
- 207 tests visible (all tests discoverable)
- 2-5 minute runtime for daily development
- 30-second smoke tests for instant validation
- <1 minute unit tests with parallel execution

**Key Principle:** Run fast tests first, expensive tests only when needed.

**Development Velocity Impact:** 5-7x faster feedback loop = more productive development.
