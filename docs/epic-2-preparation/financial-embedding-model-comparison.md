## Executive Summary

**RECOMMENDATION: Keep Fin-E5 (current model) for Epic 2**

**Rationale:**
- Fin-E5 is state-of-the-art for financial retrieval (0.7105 retrieval score vs 0.6721 FinBERT)
- Already integrated and working (Story 1.1)
- Switching requires re-embedding 321 chunks (~2-3 hours work)
- Epic 2 focus should be on hybrid search fusion, not model replacement
- **Decision:** Defer embedding model evaluation to Epic 3 (if accuracy still <90% after Epic 2)

## Key Findings

### 1. Fin-E5 is State-of-the-Art (2025)

**Performance Highlights:**
- **+3.6 points** higher retrieval score vs e5-mistral-7b base model (0.7105 vs 0.6749)
- **+0.46 points** higher vs FinBERT (0.6767 vs 0.6721 avg)
- Statistically significant (p <0.05) across all financial NLP tasks

**Why Fin-E5 Leads:**
- Domain-adapted using persona-based synthetic financial data
- Covers 7 task types: retrieval, classification, STS, clustering, reranking, pair classification, bitext mining
- Trained on 64 financial datasets (news, annual reports, ESG, regulatory filings, earnings transcripts)
- Only 100 training steps required for adaptation (efficient fine-tuning)

---

### 2. Domain Adaptation is Critical

**Research Finding:** General-purpose benchmarks (MTEB) show LIMITED correlation with financial domain performance.

**Evidence:**
- e5-mistral-7b (general): 0.6475 avg
- Fin-E5 (finance-adapted): 0.6767 avg
- **Improvement: +4.5%** from domain adaptation alone

**Implications for RAGLite:**
- Using Fin-E5 (finance-adapted) vs general e5-mistral justified
- Switching to general-purpose model would degrade retrieval accuracy
- Financial domain terminology (EBITDA, covenant, derivative) requires specialized embeddings

---

### 3. Latency vs Accuracy Trade-off

| Model Type | Accuracy (Retrieval) | Inference Speed | Parameters | Use Case |
|------------|---------------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| **LLM-based (Fin-E5)** | **0.7105** (High) | ~100-200ms | 7B | High-accuracy financial retrieval |
| BERT-based (FinBERT) | 0.6721 (Medium) | ~20-50ms | 110M-355M | Latency-critical applications |
| fin-roberta | <0.6721 (Lower) | ~20-50ms | 110M-355M | Budget-constrained deployments |

**RAGLite Context:**
- Current p50: 33.20ms, p95: 63.34ms
- NFR13 budget: 10,000ms (p95)
- **Available: 9,937ms** (99.6% budget remaining)

**Conclusion:** Fin-E5's 100-200ms latency is ACCEPTABLE given 9,937ms available budget.

## Detailed Model Profiles

### Fin-E5 (CURRENT - RECOMMENDED TO KEEP)

**Architecture:**
- Base: e5-mistral-7b-instruct (7B parameters)
- Adaptation: Persona-based synthetic financial data
- Training: 100 steps (efficient domain adaptation)

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Highest retrieval accuracy** (0.7105 on FinMTEB)
- ✅ **Financial domain expertise** (trained on annual reports, ESG, regulatory filings)
- ✅ **Multi-task capability** (retrieval, classification, STS)
- ✅ **Already integrated** in RAGLite (Story 1.1)

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠️ **Slower inference** (100-200ms vs 20-50ms for BERT)
- ⚠️ **Larger model** (7B params requires more memory)

**Use in RAGLite:**
- Current implementation: `sentence-transformers/intfloat/e5-mistral-7b-instruct`
- Re-embedding cost: ~2-3 hours for 321 chunks
- **Recommendation: KEEP** for Epic 2, re-evaluate in Epic 3 if accuracy <90%

---

### FinBERT (Alternative - Not Recommended)

**Architecture:**
- Base: BERT-base (110M parameters)
- Pre-training: Financial news articles, earnings calls
- Fine-tuning: Financial sentiment, NER tasks

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Fast inference** (20-50ms)
- ✅ **Lower memory** (110M vs 7B)
- ✅ **Established in finance NLP** (widely used 2020-2023)

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **Lower retrieval accuracy** (0.6721 vs 0.7105 Fin-E5)
- ❌ **Optimized for classification** (not retrieval)
- ❌ **Older architecture** (2019 BERT vs 2024 Mistral)

**Use Case:**
- Latency-critical apps (<50ms requirement)
- Budget-constrained deployments (limited GPU)
- **NOT suitable for RAGLite** (accuracy prioritized over speed)

---

### fin-roberta (Alternative - Not Recommended)

**Architecture:**
- Base: RoBERTa-base (125M parameters)
- Training: Financial domain corpus

**Strengths:**
- ✅ **Fast inference** (similar to FinBERT)
- ✅ **Efficient** (lower compute than LLM)

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **Lower accuracy than FinBERT** (trails both FinBERT and Fin-E5)
- ❌ **Limited benchmark data** (not included in FinMTEB leaderboard)
- ❌ **Primarily sentiment analysis** (not retrieval-optimized)

**Use Case:**
- Sentiment analysis tasks
- **NOT suitable for RAGLite** retrieval

---

## Re-Embedding Cost Analysis

### IF Switching from Fin-E5 to Alternative

**Scenario: Switch to FinBERT**

**Costs:**
1. **Re-embed 321 chunks** with FinBERT
   - Estimated time: 2-3 hours (depending on batch size)
   - Process: Run embedding on all chunks, update Qdrant collection

2. **Test accuracy regression**
   - Run full ground truth suite (50 queries)
   - Expected: Accuracy DROP (Fin-E5 0.7105 → FinBERT 0.6721 = -5.4%)
   - RAGLite baseline already low (56%) → further drop unacceptable

3. **Update pipeline code**
   - Modify `raglite/ingestion/pipeline.py` (embedding model swap)
   - Update dimension: 768 (Fin-E5) → 768 (FinBERT, same) OR 384 (DistilBERT)
   - Test integration: 1-2 hours

**Total Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Expected Benefit:** ❌ NEGATIVE (accuracy degrades, latency improvement unnecessary)

---

## Decision Matrix

### Keep Fin-E5 (RECOMMENDED)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Highest accuracy (0.7105 retrieval)
- ✅ Already integrated (zero switching cost)
- ✅ Latency acceptable (100-200ms within 9,937ms budget)
- ✅ Focus Epic 2 on hybrid search (higher ROI than model swap)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Slower than FinBERT (but irrelevant given 99.6% budget remaining)

**Impact on Epic 2 Goals:**
- Hybrid search (Story 2.1) targets +15-20% retrieval improvement
- Fin-E5 provides strong semantic baseline for fusion with BM25
- **Combined expected: 56% + 15-20% = 71-76% retrieval** (Story 2.1 alone)

---

### Switch to FinBERT (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Faster inference (20-50ms vs 100-200ms)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Accuracy DROP (-5.4% retrieval score)
- ❌ Re-embedding cost (4-6 hours effort)
- ❌ Minimal latency gain (unnecessary given 99.6% budget)
- ❌ Distracts from Epic 2 primary goal (hybrid search)

**Impact on Epic 2 Goals:**
- Starting from LOWER baseline (56% → ~53% after FinBERT switch)
- Hybrid search still needed, but harder to reach 90% target
- **NOT RECOMMENDED**

---

## Recommendations

### PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: Keep Fin-E5

**Rationale:**
1. **Accuracy is priority:** RAGLite baseline (56%) requires maximum accuracy improvement
2. **Latency is non-issue:** 99.6% budget remaining (9,937ms available)
3. **Epic 2 focus:** Hybrid search (Story 2.1) + financial embeddings (Story 2.2) more impactful
4. **Re-embedding cost unjustified:** 4-6 hours for negative ROI

**Implementation:**
- **Story 2.1:** Use Fin-E5 as semantic component in hybrid search
- **Story 2.2:** SKIP (embedding model already optimal)
- **Epic 2 validation:** Re-run accuracy tests after Story 2.1 to measure improvement

---

### ALTERNATIVE: Defer Story 2.2 to Epic 3

**If accuracy <85% after Story 2.1 hybrid search:**
- Re-evaluate embedding models in Epic 3
- Consider: Fin-E5 fine-tuning on RAGLite-specific data
- Benchmark: Fin-E5 vs newer models (2025 releases)

**If accuracy ≥85% after Story 2.1:**
- **SKIP Story 2.2 entirely** (embedding model sufficient)
- Proceed to Story 2.3 (Table-Aware Chunking) if needed

---

## Open Questions for User (Ricardo)

1. **Confirm Keep Fin-E5:** Approved to keep current embedding model for Epic 2?
2. **Story 2.2 Scope:** Defer Story 2.2 (Financial Embeddings) pending Story 2.1 results?
3. **Epic 3 Re-evaluation:** Revisit embedding models only if Epic 2 accuracy <85%?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Mark Story 2.2 as CONDITIONAL** (pending Story 2.1 validation)
2. **Focus Epic 2 prep on Story 2.1** (Hybrid Search - highest ROI)
3. **Story drafting (Bob):** Use Fin-E5 as baseline for Story 2.1 hybrid architecture
4. **Validation plan (Murat):** Re-run ground truth after Story 2.1 to decide Story 2.2 need
