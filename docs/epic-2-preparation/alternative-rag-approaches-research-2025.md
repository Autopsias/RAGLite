# Alternative RAG Enhancement Approaches - Research Summary 2025

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Context:** Story 2.1 (BM25 Hybrid Search) failed AC6 with 56% accuracy (target: ≥70%)
**Root Cause:** Whitespace tokenization inadequate for financial documents
**Goal:** Identify alternative approaches to improve retrieval accuracy beyond 56% baseline

---

## Executive Summary

Research from ICLR 2025, ArXiv 2024, and recent industry implementations reveals **7 high-impact approaches** for improving RAG retrieval on financial documents, with empirical evidence showing:

- **Contextual Retrieval**: 49-67% failure rate reduction (Anthropic, 2024)
- **Query Expansion with LLM**: Highest NDCG@10 scores (FinanceRAG ACM-ICAIF 2024)
- **Cross-encoder Reranking**: 30-50% accuracy improvement over bi-encoders
- **Element-based Chunking**: NDCG@10 improvement from 0.40 → 0.51 (27% gain)

**Recommended Approach**: **Contextual Retrieval + Cross-encoder Reranking** (estimated 2-3 week implementation)

---

## Option 1: Contextual Retrieval (HIGHEST IMPACT)

### Overview
**Source:** Anthropic (Sept 2024) - "Contextual Retrieval" blog post
**Impact:** 49% failure rate reduction (contextual embeddings + BM25) → 67% with reranking
**Complexity:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks

### How It Works
Transform context-free chunks into contextualized snippets:

**Before (Current):**
```
Chunk 42: "The company's revenue increased by 3% to EUR 23.2M."
```

**After (Contextualized):**
```
Chunk 42: "Portugal Cement Q3 2025 Results: The company's revenue increased by 3% to EUR 23.2M (vs Q2 2025: EUR 22.5M)."
```

**Key Insight:** Use LLM to add document context (company name, period, section) to each chunk before embedding/indexing.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Contextual Embedding** (Story 2.1A - Alternative)
   - Pre-process chunks: Use Claude API to add context via prompt
   - Prompt template: "Given document '{title}' section '{section}', provide 1-2 sentence context for: '{chunk}'"
   - Re-embed contextualized chunks with Fin-E5
   - Expected: 30-40% accuracy improvement

2. **Contextual BM25** (Story 2.1B - Alternative)
   - Same contextualization step
   - Re-tokenize contextualized chunks for BM25
   - Expected: Better keyword matching (context provides more terms)

3. **Combined (Contextual Retrieval + Reranking)**
   - Anthropic's results: 67% failure reduction (5.7% → 1.9%)
   - Estimated accuracy: 56% → 70-75% (14-19pp gain)

### Pros
- ✅ **Proven Results**: Anthropic tested on production workloads
- ✅ **Domain Agnostic**: Works for any document type
- ✅ **Preserves Existing Infrastructure**: Uses same Fin-E5 + Qdrant stack
- ✅ **Explainable**: Context added by LLM is human-readable

### Cons
- ❌ **One-time Cost**: Re-processing all chunks (160 pages ~321 chunks = ~$5-10 Claude API cost)
- ❌ **Storage Increase**: Contextualized chunks ~20-30% larger
- ❌ **Implementation Complexity**: Requires chunking pipeline changes

### Estimated Timeline
- **Week 1**: Implement contextualization + re-ingestion
- **Week 2**: Test + validate accuracy (target: ≥70%)
- **Success Probability**: 80% (based on Anthropic's empirical results)

---

## Option 2: Cross-encoder Reranking (HIGH IMPACT, LOW RISK)

### Overview
**Source:** OpenAI Cookbook, Qdrant Docs, ArXiv 2024
**Impact:** 30-50% accuracy improvement over bi-encoders
**Complexity:** Low
**Estimated Effort:** 3-5 days

### How It Works
Two-stage retrieval:
1. **Stage 1 (Fast)**: Bi-encoder (Fin-E5) retrieves top-20 candidates (~50ms)
2. **Stage 2 (Accurate)**: Cross-encoder reranks top-20 → top-5 (~200ms)

**Key Insight:** Cross-encoders perform joint attention (query ⊗ document) for higher accuracy, but only on shortlist.

### Recommended Models (2024 Benchmarks)

| Model | Performance | Speed | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|-------|----------|
| **monoT5** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Fast | **Recommended** - Balanced |
| **RankLLaMA** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Slow | Highest accuracy |
| **ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Very Fast | Production baseline |

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Minimal Integration** (Story 2.2 - Reranking)
   - Add cross-encoder as post-processing step in `search.py`
   - Retrieve top-20 with Fin-E5, rerank to top-5 with monoT5
   - No changes to ingestion pipeline
   - Expected: 10-15pp accuracy improvement (56% → 66-71%)

2. **Code Example** (Qdrant + HuggingFace)
```python
from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder

# Load reranker (one-time, ~500MB model)
reranker = CrossEncoder('cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2')

# After semantic search
semantic_results = await search_documents(query, top_k=20)

# Rerank
pairs = [(query, r.text) for r in semantic_results]
scores = reranker.predict(pairs)
reranked = sorted(zip(scores, semantic_results), reverse=True)[:5]
```

### Pros
- ✅ **Low Risk**: No ingestion changes, easy rollback
- ✅ **Fast Implementation**: 3-5 days
- ✅ **Industry Standard**: Used by OpenAI, Pinecone, Qdrant
- ✅ **Incremental**: Can combine with other approaches

### Cons
- ❌ **Latency**: Adds ~150-250ms per query (still within NFR13: <10s)
- ❌ **Memory**: Reranker model ~500MB RAM
- ❌ **Limited Gain Alone**: May only reach 66-71% (not guaranteed ≥70%)

### Estimated Timeline
- **Days 1-2**: Integrate cross-encoder + unit tests
- **Days 3-4**: Run validation + tune top-k parameter
- **Day 5**: Document results
- **Success Probability**: 60% to reach ≥70% (likely needs combination with other approach)

## Option 3: Query Expansion with LLM (MEDIUM IMPACT)

### Overview
**Source:** FinanceRAG ACM-ICAIF 2024 (2nd place), ArXiv 2404.07221
**Impact:** Highest NDCG@10 among query preprocessing methods
**Complexity:** Low
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

### How It Works
Expand user query into multiple variations:

**Original Query:**
```
"What is the EBITDA margin for Portugal Cement?"
```

**Expanded Queries (LLM-generated):**
```
1. "What is the EBITDA margin for Portugal Cement?"
2. "Portugal Cement EBITDA IFRS margin"
3. "Operating profit margin Portugal Cement division"
4. "Earnings before interest tax depreciation Portugal operations"
```

**Retrieval:** Search with all 4 queries, merge + deduplicate results

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Simple Expansion** (Story 2.3 - Query Expansion)
   - Prompt Claude to generate 3-4 query variations
   - Search each variation in parallel
   - Merge results (deduplicate by chunk_id)
   - Rerank merged results
   - Expected: 8-12pp improvement (56% → 64-68%)

2. **Code Example**
```python
async def expand_query(query: str) -> list[str]:
    prompt = f"""Rewrite this financial query in 3 different ways:
    - Original: {query}
    - Synonym variation (use financial domain terms)
    - Keyword extraction (key terms only)

    Return 3 queries, one per line."""

    response = anthropic.complete(prompt)
    return [query] + response.split('\n')[:3]

# Search with all variations
expanded = await expand_query("What is EBITDA margin?")
results = []
for q in expanded:
    results.extend(await search_documents(q, top_k=10))

# Deduplicate + rerank
unique = deduplicate_by_chunk_id(results)
return rerank(unique)[:5]
```

### Pros
- ✅ **Fast Implementation**: 2-3 days
- ✅ **No Ingestion Changes**: Query-time only
- ✅ **Proven in Financial Domain**: 2nd place in FinanceRAG challenge
- ✅ **Combines Well**: Can layer with reranking

### Cons
- ❌ **API Cost**: ~$0.001 per query (4 searches instead of 1)
- ❌ **Latency**: 4x search operations (~200ms total)
- ❌ **Modest Gains Alone**: Unlikely to reach ≥70% standalone

### Estimated Timeline
- **Days 1-2**: Implement expansion + deduplication
- **Day 3**: Validate accuracy
- **Success Probability**: 40% to reach ≥70% (best as complementary approach)

## Option 4: Element-based Chunking (MEDIUM IMPACT, HIGH EFFORT)

### Overview
**Source:** ArXiv 2404.07221, ArXiv 2503.15191 (ICLR 2025)
**Impact:** NDCG@10: 0.40 → 0.51 (27% improvement)
**Complexity:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks

### How It Works
Chunk by **document structure** (tables, sections, headers) instead of fixed tokens:

**Current (Token-based):**
```
Chunk 1: "... Portugal Cement Q3 Results Revenue: EUR 23.2M EBITDA..."
Chunk 2: "...Margin: 15.2% Fixed costs: EUR 6.6M Maintenance..."
```

**Element-based:**
```
Chunk 1 (Section): "Portugal Cement Q3 Results - Financial Performance"
Chunk 2 (Table): [Full Income Statement Table - 15 rows x 6 cols]
Chunk 3 (Paragraph): "Fixed costs of EUR 6.6M reflect 19% FTE reduction..."
```

**Metadata:**
```json
{
  "element_type": "table",
  "table_type": "income_statement",
  "section": "Portugal Cement Q3 Results",
  "summary": "Income statement showing EUR 23.2M revenue, 15.2% EBITDA margin"
}
```

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Docling Structure Parsing** (Story 2.4 - Structural Chunking)
   - Use Docling's built-in table detection
   - Create separate chunks for: tables, sections, paragraphs
   - Add metadata: element_type, section hierarchy, table summaries
   - Re-ingest all documents
   - Expected: 15-25pp improvement (56% → 71-81%)

### Pros
- ✅ **Highest Potential Gain**: 27% improvement in research
- ✅ **Better for Tables**: Financial reports are table-heavy
- ✅ **Metadata Filtering**: Can filter by table_type, section
- ✅ **Preserves Structure**: Tables stay intact

### Cons
- ❌ **High Complexity**: Requires chunking pipeline rewrite
- ❌ **Re-ingestion Required**: All documents must be re-processed
- ❌ **Docling Dependency**: Relies on Docling's table detection accuracy
- ❌ **Time Investment**: 2-3 weeks for full implementation

### Estimated Timeline
- **Week 1**: Implement structural chunking + metadata extraction
- **Week 2**: Re-ingest documents + test
- **Week 3**: Validate accuracy + tune metadata filters
- **Success Probability**: 70% to reach ≥70% (high potential but high risk)

## Option 5: Domain-Specific Fine-tuning (HIGHEST POTENTIAL, LONGEST TIMELINE)

### Overview
**Source:** ArXiv 2404.07221, ArXiv 2503.15191
**Impact:** NDCG@10: 0.40 → 0.51 with fine-tuned embeddings
**Complexity:** Very High
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 weeks

### How It Works
Fine-tune Fin-E5 (intfloat/e5-large-v2) on financial Q&A pairs using contrastive learning:

**Training Data:**
```
(query: "What is EBITDA margin?",
 positive: "Portugal Cement EBITDA margin is 15.2%",
 negative: "Portugal Cement revenue is EUR 23.2M")
```

**Fine-tuning Method:** Contrastive learning (triplets)

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Collect Training Data** (Week 1-2)
   - Use 50 ground truth queries + failures
   - Generate 200+ additional Q&A pairs with Claude
   - Label positive/negative passages manually

2. **Fine-tune Fin-E5** (Week 3-4)
   - Use Sentence Transformers `fit()` API
   - Contrastive loss: `(query, positive, negative)` triplets
   - Validate on held-out test set

3. **Deploy Fine-tuned Model** (Week 5-6)
   - Re-embed all chunks with fine-tuned model
   - Compare accuracy: baseline Fin-E5 vs fine-tuned

### Pros
- ✅ **Highest Long-term Potential**: Model learns domain language
- ✅ **Compound Benefits**: Improves all retrieval types
- ✅ **Research Validated**: Multiple papers show 20-30% gains

### Cons
- ❌ **Longest Timeline**: 4-6 weeks
- ❌ **Data Requirements**: Needs 200+ labeled examples
- ❌ **GPU Required**: Fine-tuning needs powerful hardware
- ❌ **Risk of Overfitting**: Small dataset may not generalize

### Estimated Timeline
- **Weeks 1-2**: Data collection + labeling
- **Weeks 3-4**: Fine-tuning + validation
- **Weeks 5-6**: Re-ingestion + accuracy testing
- **Success Probability**: 75% to reach ≥70% (but longest investment)

## Option 6: ColBERT Late Interaction (EMERGING)

### Overview
**Source:** ArXiv 2024, Medium blog posts
**Impact:** 100x faster than cross-encoders, comparable accuracy
**Complexity:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks

### How It Works
Dual-encoder with late interaction:
- Encode query and document separately (like bi-encoders)
- Perform MaxSim (maximum similarity) between token embeddings
- 100x faster than cross-encoders at scale

### Pros
- ✅ **Efficiency**: Faster than cross-encoders
- ✅ **Accuracy**: Better than bi-encoders

### Cons
- ❌ **Immature Ecosystem**: Fewer production examples
- ❌ **Complex Integration**: Requires custom scoring logic
- ❌ **Storage**: Needs per-token embeddings (10x storage vs bi-encoders)

**Recommendation:** **Wait for ecosystem maturity** - Not ready for production in 2024-2025

## Option 7: Multi-stage Reranking Pipeline (COMPREHENSIVE)

### Overview
**Source:** ArXiv 2411.16732 (FinanceRAG Challenge - 2nd place)
**Impact:** State-of-the-art results on financial documents
**Complexity:** Very High
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 weeks

### How It Works
Three-phase RAG pipeline:

1. **Pre-retrieval**: Query expansion + corpus refinement
2. **Retrieval**: Fine-tuned embeddings + hybrid strategy
3. **Post-retrieval**: Cross-encoder reranking + DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)

### Pros
- ✅ **Highest Accuracy**: 2nd place in FinanceRAG challenge
- ✅ **Comprehensive**: Addresses all stages of retrieval

### Cons
- ❌ **Complexity**: Requires all components
- ❌ **Long Timeline**: 4-6 weeks for full implementation
- ❌ **Over-engineering Risk**: May be overkill for MVP

**Recommendation:** **Phase 3+ approach** - Save for production optimization
