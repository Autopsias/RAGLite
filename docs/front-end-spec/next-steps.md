# Next Steps

## Immediate Actions

1. **Design Handoff to Architect**
   - Architect reviews this spec during architecture design phase
   - UX patterns inform MCP response formatting implementation
   - Error handling patterns guide robustness requirements

2. **Architect Incorporates UX Requirements**
   - Response format templates implemented as prompt engineering patterns
   - Error handling logic maps to graceful degradation architecture (NFR32)
   - Performance targets drive database/API optimization decisions

3. **Development Implementation**
   - MCP tool responses follow specified formats
   - Error patterns implemented in exception handling
   - Performance monitoring tracks p50/p95 against targets

## Design Handoff Checklist

- [x] All user flows documented with entry points and success criteria
- [x] Response format structures defined with examples
- [x] Error handling patterns comprehensive (6 core scenarios)
- [x] Accessibility approach documented (text-native, screen-reader friendly)
- [x] Performance considerations tied to PRD targets
- [x] UX principles established (clarity, attribution, transparency, graceful failure)

## Open Questions for Architect

1. **Response Streaming:** Can MCP protocol support progressive response delivery for long workflows?
2. **Client Capabilities:** Do all MCP clients render markdown tables correctly? Fallback format needed?
3. **Caching Strategy:** What query/response caching is feasible within MCP architecture?
4. **Progress Indicators:** How to communicate workflow progress through MCP (if supported)?
5. **Confidence Levels:** Numerical (85%) vs. Qualitative (High/Medium/Low) for forecast confidence?

## Success Criteria for UX Validation

**MVP User Acceptance (from PRD):**

- ✅ **User satisfaction:** 8/10+ rating for accuracy and usefulness
- ✅ **Retrieval accuracy:** 90%+ validated on test query set
- ✅ **Source attribution:** 95%+ accuracy verified
- ✅ **Performance:** <5 sec typical, <30 sec workflows met
- ✅ **Adoption:** System used for 90%+ of financial queries (replaces manual methods)
- ✅ **Insight quality:** 75%+ of proactive insights rated useful/actionable

**Ongoing Measurement:**

- User query patterns (what questions are asked most)
- Error rate tracking (which error patterns occur most)
- Performance monitoring (p50/p95 response times by query type)
- Follow-up question rate (indicates clarity of initial response)
