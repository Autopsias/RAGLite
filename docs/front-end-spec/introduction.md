# Introduction

This document defines the conversational interaction patterns, response format specifications, and user experience guidelines for RAGLite's MCP (Model Context Protocol) interface. Since RAGLite has no custom UI and operates entirely through MCP-compatible clients (Claude Desktop initially), this specification ensures consistent, user-centered responses that deliver financial intelligence through natural language conversation.
