# Overall UX Goals & Principles

## Target User Personas

**Primary Persona - Financial Analyst:**
- Finance team members who spend 40-60% of their time manually searching through PDFs and Excel spreadsheets
- Need quick, accurate answers to stakeholder questions about financial performance
- Value time savings and decision quality over learning new tools
- Expect professional, analytical tone and verifiable sources

**Secondary Persona - Finance Leader:**
- Senior finance professionals making strategic decisions
- Need proactive insights and trends, not just answers to questions
- Limited time for deep document analysis
- Require high confidence in data accuracy and attribution

**Future Persona - Team Collaborator (Post-MVP):**
- Multiple team members accessing shared financial intelligence
- Need consistent, reliable answers across team
- Value collaboration features and shared insight discovery

## Usability Goals

1. **Instant Comprehension:** Users ask questions in plain language without learning query syntax - natural conversation eliminates learning curve
2. **Trust Through Verification:** Every answer includes verifiable source attribution (95%+ accuracy) enabling users to validate critical information
3. **Efficient Discovery:** 80% reduction in time-to-insight (hours/days â†’ minutes) through conversational access to comprehensive knowledge base
4. **Progressive Complexity:** Simple queries get simple answers (2-3 paragraphs); complex analysis revealed through follow-up questions
5. **Proactive Value:** System surfaces insights users should know, not just what they ask - 75%+ rated useful/actionable

## Design Principles

1. **Clarity over cleverness** - Prioritize clear, professional financial communication over conversational personality
2. **Source attribution by default** - Every factual claim must include verifiable document reference
3. **Progressive disclosure** - Show only what's needed, when it's needed; complex workflows execute invisibly
4. **Immediate, transparent feedback** - Users understand what the system is doing (retrieving, analyzing, forecasting) and why
5. **Fail gracefully with guidance** - Errors provide alternative questions or explain what's missing, never dead-ends
