**Stories in TODO:** 1 (Story 2.8 - Table-Aware Chunking)
**Stories in IN PROGRESS:** 0 (awaiting Story 2.8 drafting)
**Stories DONE:** 7 (Week 0 + Epic 1 + Stories 2.1-2.7)
**Stories ON HOLD:** 2 (Phase 2B Stories 2.12-2.13 pending Phase 2A re-validation)

**Epic Breakdown:**

- Epic 1: Foundation & Accurate Retrieval (COMPLETE - 100%)
- Epic 2: Advanced RAG Architecture Enhancement (IN PROGRESS - 7/11 stories complete, Phase 1 COMPLETE ✅, Phase 2A Initial COMPLETE ✅, Phase 2A Course Correction IN PROGRESS - Stories 2.8-2.11 approved)
  - Phase 1 (Stories 2.1-2.2): ✅ COMPLETE

- Epic 5: Production Readiness & Real-Time Operations (PLANNED - 0% complete, blocked by Epic 4)

#### State Transition Logic

**Story Lifecycle:**

```
BACKLOG → TODO → IN PROGRESS → DONE
```

**Transition Rules:**

1. **BACKLOG → TODO**: Automatically when previous story moves TODO → IN PROGRESS
2. **TODO → IN PROGRESS**: User runs SM agent `*story-ready` workflow after reviewing drafted story
3. **IN PROGRESS → DONE**: User runs DEV agent `story-approved` workflow after DoD complete

**Important:**

- SM agent NEVER searches for "next story" - always reads TODO section
- DEV agent NEVER searches for "current story" - always reads IN PROGRESS section
- Both agents update this status file after their workflows complete

**Current State (2025-10-25):**
- Story 2.7 COMPLETE ✅ (Multi-Index Search Architecture with PostgreSQL + Qdrant)
- Story 2.8 in IN PROGRESS (Cross-Encoder Re-Ranking for +3-5pp accuracy improvement)
- Story 2.9 in TODO (AC3 Final Validation ≥70% - Phase 2B decision gate)
- **Epic 2 Phase 1 COMPLETE:** Stories 2.1 + 2.2 done ✅ (pypdfium + parallelism)
- **Epic 2 Phase 2A COMPLETE:** Stories 2.3-2.5 done ✅ (fixed chunking + metadata + validation)
- **Epic 2 Phase 2B IN PROGRESS:** Stories 2.6-2.7 complete ✅, Story 2.8 in progress (re-ranking)

10. Complete Epic 2 Phase 2A (Stories 2.3-2.5)
11. Execute Decision Gate at T+17 (Week 3, Day 3)
12. IF ≥70% accuracy → Epic 2 COMPLETE → Proceed to Epic 3

## Special Considerations

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Epic 2 Strategic Pivot**
- Epic 2 was redefined on 2025-10-19 following catastrophic failure of element-aware chunking (Story 2.2 original approach)
- Original approach: Element-aware chunking achieved 42% accuracy (vs 56% baseline = -14pp regression)
- Root cause: Implemented exact failure mode warned against in research (Yepes et al. 2024)
- New approach: Staged RAG architecture with decision gates and research-validated techniques

**Epic 2 Decision Gates:**
- **T+1 (Week 1, Day 1):** Story 2.1 complete (pypdfium backend) → Proceed to Story 2.2 or escalate
- **T+2 (Week 1, Day 2):** Story 2.2 complete (parallelism) → Phase 1 complete, proceed to Phase 2A
- **T+17 (Week 3, Day 3):** Story 2.5 AC3 validation → CRITICAL DECISION GATE
  - IF ≥70% accuracy → Epic 2 COMPLETE ✅
  - IF <70% accuracy → Escalate to Phase 2B (Structured Multi-Index, +3-4 weeks)

**Technology Stack Constraints:**
- Technology stack is LOCKED per docs/architecture/5-technology-stack-definitive.md
- NO new dependencies without explicit user approval
- KISS principle enforced - no abstractions, no frameworks, no wrappers
- Target: ~600-800 lines of Python code across 15 files

**Anti-Over-Engineering:**
- All code must follow CLAUDE.md constraints
- Direct SDK usage only (no custom wrappers)
- No abstractions beyond simple utility functions
- Reference implementation patterns in section 6 of architecture docs

## Technical Preferences Captured

**Development Stack:**
- Python 3.11+
- Docling 2.55.1 (PDF processing) with pypdfium backend (Story 2.1)
- Fin-E5 embeddings (financial domain)
- Qdrant 1.11+ (vector database)
- FastMCP 2.12.4 (MCP server framework)
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet (LLM for synthesis)

**Testing Framework:**
- pytest 8.4.2 with pytest-asyncio
- pytest-xdist for parallel execution
- Target: 80%+ code coverage
- Ground truth test set: 50+ Q&A pairs
- Accuracy validation: Daily during Epic 2

**Quality Gates:**
- NFR6: 90%+ retrieval accuracy (current: 42%, target Epic 2: ≥70%)
- NFR7: 95%+ source attribution accuracy
- NFR9: 95%+ table extraction accuracy (current: 97.9%)
- NFR13: <15s p95 query response time

## Story Naming Convention

Sprint Change: Add Stories 2.8-2.11 for Phase 2A course correction (16-22 hours, 2-3 days). Root Cause: Story 2.5 FAILED at 52% accuracy (18pp below ≥70% target). Deep-dive analysis identified 4 critical fixable issues: (1) Severe table fragmentation (8.6 chunks/table), (2) Broken ground truth (zero page references), (3) Query over-routing (48% SQL when 4% needed), (4) Hybrid search scoring bug (all results score=1.0). Decision: PIVOT from Phase 2B back to Phase 2A fundamentals. Expected Outcome: 65-75% accuracy (meets ≥70% threshold). ROI: 15:1 to 120:1 if successful (avoids 3-24 weeks Phase 2B/2C). Timeline Impact: +1 week to Epic 2 completion. Backlog Updates: Stories 2.8-2.11 added to backlog (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM priorities), Stories 2.12-2.13 (Phase 2B) moved to ON HOLD. Files Updated: `docs/sprint-status.yaml`, `docs/bmm-workflow-status.md`. Next: SM agent to draft Story 2.8 (Table-Aware Chunking Strategy) using `create-story` workflow.
