| 5 | 1 | 5.1 | TBD - Production Deployment (pending Epic 4 completion) | story-5.1.md |

**Total in backlog:** 4 stories (1 Phase 2B on hold, 3 placeholder for Epic 3-5)

**Instructions:**

- Stories move from BACKLOG → TODO when previous story is complete

**Stories DONE:** 14 (Week 0 + Epic 1 + Stories 2.1-2.11, 2.13)
**Stories ON HOLD:** 1 (Phase 2B Story 2.12 pending Story 2.14 completion)

**Epic Breakdown:**

- Epic 1: Foundation & Accurate Retrieval (COMPLETE - 100%)
- Epic 2: Advanced RAG Architecture Enhancement (IN PROGRESS - 14/15 stories complete, 93% done)
  - Phase 1 (Stories 2.1-2.2): ✅ COMPLETE
  - Phase 2A Initial (Stories 2.3-2.7): ✅ COMPLETE (18% accuracy - FAILED decision gate)
  - Phase 2A Course Correction (Stories 2.8-2.10): ✅ COMPLETE
  - Phase 2A-REVISED SQL Table Search (Stories 2.11-2.14): 🔄 IN PROGRESS

- Epic 5: Production Readiness & Real-Time Operations (PLANNED - 0% complete, blocked by Epic 4)

#### State Transition Logic

**Story Lifecycle:**

```
BACKLOG → TODO → IN PROGRESS → DONE
```

**Transition Rules:**

1. **BACKLOG → TODO**: Automatically when previous story moves TODO → IN PROGRESS
2. **TODO → IN PROGRESS**: User runs SM agent `*story-ready` workflow after reviewing drafted story
3. **IN PROGRESS → DONE**: User runs DEV agent `story-approved` workflow after DoD complete

**Important:**

- SM agent NEVER searches for "next story" - always reads TODO section
- DEV agent NEVER searches for "current story" - always reads IN PROGRESS section
- Both agents update this status file after their workflows complete

**Current State (2025-10-27):**
- Story 2.11 COMPLETE ✅ (Fix Hybrid Search Scoring - AC1-AC3 done)
- Story 2.14 IN PROGRESS 🔄 (SQL Backend Integration + Edge Case Refinement - expanded scope, Epic 2 completion blocker)
- Stories 2.1-2.11, 2.13 COMPLETE ✅ (14 stories done, 125 points delivered)
- **Epic 2 Phase 1 COMPLETE:** Stories 2.1-2.2 done ✅ (pypdfium + parallelism)
- **Epic 2 Phase 2A Initial COMPLETE:** Stories 2.3-2.7 done ✅ - FAILED at 18% accuracy
- **Epic 2 Phase 2A Course Correction COMPLETE:** Stories 2.8-2.10 done ✅
- **Epic 2 Phase 2A-REVISED IN PROGRESS:** Story 2.13 COMPLETE ✅ (AC1-AC3 production-ready), Story 2.11 COMPLETE ✅ (hybrid search scoring fixed), Story 2.14 IN PROGRESS (SQL backend integration)

- 🔄 Epic 2: Advanced RAG Architecture Enhancement (IN PROGRESS - Phase 1 starting)
- ⏳ Epic 3-5: Pending Epic 2 completion (≥70% accuracy decision gate)

### Workflow Sequence

**Completed Workflows:**
1. ✅ Week 0 Integration Spike (Analysis/Validation)
2. ✅ PRD Creation (PM - Level 3 project)
3. ✅ Solution Architecture (Architect - Level 3 required)
4. ✅ Epic 1 Implementation (Dev - Foundation complete)

**Current Workflow:**
5. 🔄 Story 2.1 Context Validation (SM - COMPLETE today)
6. ⏭️ Story 2.1 Ready Workflow (SM - NEXT STEP)
7. ⏭️ Story 2.1 Implementation (Dev - after approval)

**Upcoming Workflows:**
8. Story 2.2-2.5 (Epic 2 Phase 1 + 2A)
9. Decision Gate (T+17, Week 3 Day 3 - ≥70% accuracy required)
10. Epic 3-5 Implementation (conditional on Epic 2 success)

### Next Actions

**Immediate (Today):**
1. ✅ Story 2.1 context validated (90% quality score)
2. ⏭️ Run `*story-ready` workflow to approve Story 2.1 for development
3. ⏭️ Move Story 2.1 from TODO → IN PROGRESS
4. ⏭️ Move Story 2.2 from BACKLOG → TODO

**Short-term (Week 1, Day 1-2):**
5. Implement Story 2.1 (pypdfium backend - 4 hours)
6. Validate Story 2.1 DoD complete (memory reduction, table accuracy)
7. Run `story-approved` workflow to mark Story 2.1 DONE
8. Draft Story 2.2 context (page-level parallelism)

**Medium-term (Week 1-3):**
9. Complete Epic 2 Phase 1 (Stories 2.1-2.2)
10. Complete Epic 2 Phase 2A (Stories 2.3-2.5)
11. Execute Decision Gate at T+17 (Week 3, Day 3)
12. IF ≥70% accuracy → Epic 2 COMPLETE → Proceed to Epic 3

## Special Considerations

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Epic 2 Strategic Pivot**
- Epic 2 was redefined on 2025-10-19 following catastrophic failure of element-aware chunking (Story 2.2 original approach)
- Original approach: Element-aware chunking achieved 42% accuracy (vs 56% baseline = -14pp regression)
- Root cause: Implemented exact failure mode warned against in research (Yepes et al. 2024)
- New approach: Staged RAG architecture with decision gates and research-validated techniques

**Epic 2 Decision Gates:**
- **T+1 (Week 1, Day 1):** Story 2.1 complete (pypdfium backend) → Proceed to Story 2.2 or escalate
- **T+2 (Week 1, Day 2):** Story 2.2 complete (parallelism) → Phase 1 complete, proceed to Phase 2A
- **T+17 (Week 3, Day 3):** Story 2.5 AC3 validation → CRITICAL DECISION GATE
  - IF ≥70% accuracy → Epic 2 COMPLETE ✅
  - IF <70% accuracy → Escalate to Phase 2B (Structured Multi-Index, +3-4 weeks)

**Technology Stack Constraints:**
- Technology stack is LOCKED per docs/architecture/5-technology-stack-definitive.md
- NO new dependencies without explicit user approval
- KISS principle enforced - no abstractions, no frameworks, no wrappers
- Target: ~600-800 lines of Python code across 15 files

**Anti-Over-Engineering:**
- All code must follow CLAUDE.md constraints
- Direct SDK usage only (no custom wrappers)
- No abstractions beyond simple utility functions
- Reference implementation patterns in section 6 of architecture docs

## Technical Preferences Captured

**Development Stack:**
- Python 3.11+
- Docling 2.55.1 (PDF processing) with pypdfium backend (Story 2.1)
- Fin-E5 embeddings (financial domain)
- Qdrant 1.11+ (vector database)
- FastMCP 2.12.4 (MCP server framework)
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet (LLM for synthesis)

**Testing Framework:**
- pytest 8.4.2 with pytest-asyncio
- pytest-xdist for parallel execution
- Target: 80%+ code coverage
- Ground truth test set: 50+ Q&A pairs
- Accuracy validation: Daily during Epic 2

**Quality Gates:**
- NFR6: 90%+ retrieval accuracy (current: 42%, target Epic 2: ≥70%)
- NFR7: 95%+ source attribution accuracy
- NFR9: 95%+ table extraction accuracy (current: 97.9%)
- NFR13: <15s p95 query response time

Found 2 P1-BLOCKERS (AI1: incorrect async client assessment - RETRACTED, AI2: UUID registration - already fixed in code) + 1 HIGH priority (AI3: datetime timezone). User challenged AI1 assessment. After MCP tool verification (ref_search_documentation, searchGitHub), discovered Mistral SDK 1.0+ uses unified `Mistral` class (AsyncMistral deprecated). AI1 RETRACTED - implementation was correct. All remaining issues fixed: AI3 datetime timezone-awareness applied to migration script. Test Results: Dry-run validation passing ✅. Files Modified: 1 (migrate-to-postgresql.py - datetime.now(UTC)).

Sprint Change: Add Stories 2.8-2.11 for Phase 2A course correction (16-22 hours, 2-3 days). Root Cause: Story 2.5 FAILED at 52% accuracy (18pp below ≥70% target). Deep-dive analysis identified 4 critical fixable issues: (1) Severe table fragmentation (8.6 chunks/table), (2) Broken ground truth (zero page references), (3) Query over-routing (48% SQL when 4% needed), (4) Hybrid search scoring bug (all results score=1.0). Decision: PIVOT from Phase 2B back to Phase 2A fundamentals. Expected Outcome: 65-75% accuracy (meets ≥70% threshold). ROI: 15:1 to 120:1 if successful (avoids 3-24 weeks Phase 2B/2C). Timeline Impact: +1 week to Epic 2 completion. Backlog Updates: Stories 2.8-2.11 added to backlog (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM priorities), Stories 2.12-2.13 (Phase 2B) moved to ON HOLD. Files Updated: `docs/sprint-status.yaml`, `docs/bmm-workflow-status.md`. Next: SM agent to draft Story 2.8 (Table-Aware Chunking Strategy) using `create-story` workflow.
- **2025-10-25**: Story 2.8 (Table-Aware Chunking Strategy) APPROVED and marked COMPLETE. All acceptance criteria validated: AC1 ✅ (table detection and preservation), AC2 ✅ (large table row-based splitting), AC3 ✅ (re-ingestion validation - 1.25 chunks/table vs ≤1.5 target), AC4 ✅ (chunk quality spot-checks), AC5 ✅ (semantic dilution monitoring). Re-ingestion Results: Total chunks 190 (down from ~500), table chunks 171, chunks per table 1.25 (down from 8.6 - 86% improvement), all tables <4096 tokens, processing time 13min (160-page PDF). Expected accuracy impact: +10-15pp from restored table semantic coherence. Story 2.8 moved: TODO → DONE (completed 2025-10-25, 8 points). Story 2.9 (Fix Ground Truth Page References) moved to TODO (ready for DEV implementation). Updated story counts: 10 DONE, 1 TODO, 0 IN PROGRESS, 5 BACKLOG. Updated points: 103 completed (81% overall progress). **Epic 2 Phase 2A Course Correction progress:** Story 2.8 complete ✅ (1/4 stories), Stories 2.9-2.11 remaining. Next: DEV agent to implement Story 2.9 using `dev-story` workflow.
