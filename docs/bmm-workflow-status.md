- Use this as your roadmap to know what comes after each phase

### Implementation Progress (Phase 4 Only)

**Story Tracking:** Epic-based (Level 3 project)

#### BACKLOG (Not Yet Drafted)

**Ordered story sequence - populated at Phase 4 start:**

| Epic | Story | ID  | Title | File |
| ---- | ----- | --- | ----- | ---- |
| 2 | 4 | 2.4 | Add LLM-Generated Contextual Metadata Injection | story-2.4.md |
| 2 | 5 | 2.5 | AC3 Validation and Optimization (Decision Gate) | story-2.5.md |
| 3 | 1 | 3.1 | TBD - Agentic Orchestration (pending Epic 2 completion) | story-3.1.md |
| 4 | 1 | 4.1 | TBD - Forecasting Features (pending Epic 3 completion) | story-4.1.md |
| 5 | 1 | 5.1 | TBD - Production Deployment (pending Epic 4 completion) | story-5.1.md |

**Total in backlog:** 5 stories (2 defined for Epic 2, 3 placeholder for Epic 3-5)

**Instructions:**

- Stories move from BACKLOG → TODO when previous story is complete
- SM agent uses story information from this table to draft new stories
- Story order is sequential (Epic 2 stories first, then Epic 3-5 after decision gates)

#### TODO (Needs Drafting)

- **Story ID:** 2.3
- **Story Title:** Refactor Chunking Strategy to Fixed 512-Token Approach
- **Story File:** `docs/stories/story-2.3.md`
- **Status:** Not created (needs drafting)
- **Action:** SM should run `*create-story` workflow to draft this story after Story 2.2 complete

**Instructions:**

- Only ONE story in TODO at a time
- Story stays in TODO until user marks it "ready for development"
- SM reads this section to know which story to draft next
- **CURRENT STATE:** Story 2.2 is IN PROGRESS, Story 2.3 awaits drafting when Story 2.2 completes

#### IN PROGRESS (Approved for Development)

- **Story ID:** 2.2
- **Story Title:** Implement Page-Level Parallelism (4-8 Threads)
- **Story File:** `docs/stories/story-2.2.md`
- **Story Status:** Ready
- **Context File:** `docs/stories/story-context-2.2.xml`
- **Action:** DEV should run `dev-story` workflow to implement this story

**Instructions:**

- Only ONE story in IN PROGRESS at a time
- Story stays here until user marks it "approved" (DoD complete)
- DEV reads this section to know which story to implement
- After DEV completes story, user reviews and runs `story-approved` workflow

#### DONE (Completed Stories)

| Story ID | File | Completed Date | Points |
| -------- | ---- | -------------- | ------ |
| Week 0 Integration Spike | docs/stories/0.1.week-0-integration-spike.md | 2025-10-19 | 8 |
| Epic 1 Stories | Multiple (Epic 1 scope) | 2025-10-19 | 40 |
| 2.1 | docs/stories/story-2.1.md | 2025-10-19 | 5 |

**Total completed:** 3 stories (Week 0 + Epic 1 + Story 2.1)
**Total points completed:** 53 points

**Instructions:**

- Stories move here when user runs `story-approved` workflow (DEV agent)
- Immutable record of completed work
- Used for velocity tracking and progress reporting

#### Epic/Story Summary

**Total Epics:** 5 (Epic 1-5)
**Total Stories:** ~30 estimated (5 defined for Epic 2, rest TBD)
**Stories in Backlog:** 5 (2 Epic 2 stories, 3 placeholder Epic 3-5)
**Stories in TODO:** 1 (Story 2.3 - needs drafting)
**Stories in IN PROGRESS:** 1 (Story 2.2 - in development)
**Stories DONE:** 3 (Week 0 + Epic 1 + Story 2.1)

**Epic Breakdown:**

- Epic 1: Foundation & Accurate Retrieval (COMPLETE - 100%)
- Epic 2: Advanced RAG Architecture Enhancement (IN PROGRESS - 1/5 stories complete, Story 2.2 in development)
- Epic 3: AI Intelligence & Orchestration (PLANNED - 0% complete, blocked by Epic 2)
- Epic 4: Forecasting & Proactive Insights (PLANNED - 0% complete, blocked by Epic 3)
- Epic 5: Production Readiness & Real-Time Operations (PLANNED - 0% complete, blocked by Epic 4)

#### State Transition Logic

**Story Lifecycle:**

```
BACKLOG → TODO → IN PROGRESS → DONE
```

**Transition Rules:**

1. **BACKLOG → TODO**: Automatically when previous story moves TODO → IN PROGRESS
2. **TODO → IN PROGRESS**: User runs SM agent `*story-ready` workflow after reviewing drafted story
3. **IN PROGRESS → DONE**: User runs DEV agent `story-approved` workflow after DoD complete

**Important:**

- SM agent NEVER searches for "next story" - always reads TODO section
- DEV agent NEVER searches for "current story" - always reads IN PROGRESS section
- Both agents update this status file after their workflows complete

**Current State (2025-10-19):**
- Story 2.1 in TODO with validated context (ready for `*story-ready`)
- Story 2.2 in BACKLOG (will move to TODO after 2.1 → IN PROGRESS)

### Workflow Sequence

**Completed Workflows:**
1. ✅ Week 0 Integration Spike (Analysis/Validation)
2. ✅ PRD Creation (PM - Level 3 project)
3. ✅ Solution Architecture (Architect - Level 3 required)
4. ✅ Epic 1 Implementation (Dev - Foundation complete)

**Current Workflow:**
5. 🔄 Story 2.1 Context Validation (SM - COMPLETE today)
6. ⏭️ Story 2.1 Ready Workflow (SM - NEXT STEP)
7. ⏭️ Story 2.1 Implementation (Dev - after approval)

**Upcoming Workflows:**
8. Story 2.2-2.5 (Epic 2 Phase 1 + 2A)
9. Decision Gate (T+17, Week 3 Day 3 - ≥70% accuracy required)
10. Epic 3-5 Implementation (conditional on Epic 2 success)

### Next Actions

**Immediate (Today):**
1. ✅ Story 2.1 context validated (90% quality score)
2. ⏭️ Run `*story-ready` workflow to approve Story 2.1 for development
3. ⏭️ Move Story 2.1 from TODO → IN PROGRESS
4. ⏭️ Move Story 2.2 from BACKLOG → TODO

**Short-term (Week 1, Day 1-2):**
5. Implement Story 2.1 (pypdfium backend - 4 hours)
6. Validate Story 2.1 DoD complete (memory reduction, table accuracy)
7. Run `story-approved` workflow to mark Story 2.1 DONE
8. Draft Story 2.2 context (page-level parallelism)

**Medium-term (Week 1-3):**
9. Complete Epic 2 Phase 1 (Stories 2.1-2.2)
10. Complete Epic 2 Phase 2A (Stories 2.3-2.5)
11. Execute Decision Gate at T+17 (Week 3, Day 3)
12. IF ≥70% accuracy → Epic 2 COMPLETE → Proceed to Epic 3

## Special Considerations

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Epic 2 Strategic Pivot**
- Epic 2 was redefined on 2025-10-19 following catastrophic failure of element-aware chunking (Story 2.2 original approach)
- Original approach: Element-aware chunking achieved 42% accuracy (vs 56% baseline = -14pp regression)
- Root cause: Implemented exact failure mode warned against in research (Yepes et al. 2024)
- New approach: Staged RAG architecture with decision gates and research-validated techniques

**Epic 2 Decision Gates:**
- **T+1 (Week 1, Day 1):** Story 2.1 complete (pypdfium backend) → Proceed to Story 2.2 or escalate
- **T+2 (Week 1, Day 2):** Story 2.2 complete (parallelism) → Phase 1 complete, proceed to Phase 2A
- **T+17 (Week 3, Day 3):** Story 2.5 AC3 validation → CRITICAL DECISION GATE
  - IF ≥70% accuracy → Epic 2 COMPLETE ✅
  - IF <70% accuracy → Escalate to Phase 2B (Structured Multi-Index, +3-4 weeks)

**Technology Stack Constraints:**
- Technology stack is LOCKED per docs/architecture/5-technology-stack-definitive.md
- NO new dependencies without explicit user approval
- KISS principle enforced - no abstractions, no frameworks, no wrappers
- Target: ~600-800 lines of Python code across 15 files

**Anti-Over-Engineering:**
- All code must follow CLAUDE.md constraints
- Direct SDK usage only (no custom wrappers)
- No abstractions beyond simple utility functions
- Reference implementation patterns in section 6 of architecture docs

## Technical Preferences Captured

**Development Stack:**
- Python 3.11+
- Docling 2.55.1 (PDF processing) with pypdfium backend (Story 2.1)
- Fin-E5 embeddings (financial domain)
- Qdrant 1.11+ (vector database)
- FastMCP 2.12.4 (MCP server framework)
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet (LLM for synthesis)

**Testing Framework:**
- pytest 8.4.2 with pytest-asyncio
- pytest-xdist for parallel execution
- Target: 80%+ code coverage
- Ground truth test set: 50+ Q&A pairs
- Accuracy validation: Daily during Epic 2

**Quality Gates:**
