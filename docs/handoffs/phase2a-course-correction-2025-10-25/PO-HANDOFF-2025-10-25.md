# Product Owner Handoff - Phase 2A Course Correction

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Prepared By:** Product Manager (John)
**Handoff To:** Product Owner
**Related:** Sprint Change Proposal (Phase 2A Course Correction)

---

## Executive Summary

**Sprint Change:** Add 4 new stories (2.8-2.11) to current sprint for Phase 2A course correction
**Trigger:** Story 2.5 FAILED with 52% accuracy (vs ‚â•70% target)
**Impact:** +2-3 days to Epic 2 timeline (3-4 weeks total, was 2-3 weeks)
**Approval:** User (Ricardo) + PM (John) approved 2025-10-25
**Status:** READY FOR PO BACKLOG PRIORITIZATION

---

## Business Context

### Problem Statement

Phase 2A (Advanced RAG Architecture) achieved **52% retrieval accuracy** after completing Stories 2.3-2.7, falling **18 percentage points short** of the 70% target required for Epic 2 completion.

### Root Cause Analysis

Deep-dive investigation identified **4 critical issues:**

1. **Table Fragmentation** (CRITICAL): 8.6 chunks per table destroying semantic coherence
2. **Broken Ground Truth** (CRITICAL): Zero page references preventing proper validation
3. **Query Over-Routing** (HIGH): 48% SQL routing when only 4% needed, adding 500ms latency
4. **Scoring Bug** (MEDIUM): Hybrid search returning score=1.0, hiding ranking quality

### Strategic Decision

**Option Selected:** Direct Adjustment (4 new stories, 2-3 days)

**Alternatives Rejected:**
- Rollback Stories 2.3-2.7: 5-7 days, higher risk
- Proceed to Phase 2B immediately: 3-4 weeks, premature escalation

**Rationale:** Targeted fixes address root causes with minimal timeline impact and high probability of success (80% chance of 65-75% accuracy).

## Scope Change Request

### New Stories Added

**Story 2.8: Table-Aware Chunking**
- **Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL
- **Effort:** 6-8 hours

- **Risk:** LOW (standard document processing practice)

**Story 2.9: Fix Ground Truth Page References**
- **Priority:** üî¥ CRITICAL
- **Effort:** 3-4 hours
- **Business Value:** Valid accuracy metrics, confidence in measurements
- **Risk:** NONE (data quality improvement, no code changes)

**Story 2.10: Fix Query Classification**
- **Priority:** üü† HIGH
- **Effort:** 3-4 hours
- **Business Value:** -300-500ms latency reduction, better user experience
- **Risk:** LOW (heuristic tuning)

**Story 2.11: Fix Hybrid Search Scoring**
- **Priority:** üü° MEDIUM
- **Effort:** 4-6 hours
- **Business Value:** Improved ranking quality, debugging visibility

- Week 2-3: Phase 2A (Stories 2.3-2.7) ‚úÖ COMPLETE (52% accuracy)
- Week 3: Story 2.5 DECISION GATE ‚Üí ‚â•70% ‚Üí Epic 2 COMPLETE
- **Total: 2-3 weeks**

### Revised Timeline (After Course Correction)

- **Total: 3-4 weeks**

**Timeline Slip:** +1 week (acceptable within project buffer)

---

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Investment
- **Effort:** 16-22 hours (2-3 days)
- **Cost:** ~$1,200-$1,600 (assuming $75/hour dev rate)
- **Timeline:** +1 week to Epic 2

### Expected Return
- **Best Case (80% probability):** 65-75% accuracy
  - IF ‚â•70%: Epic 2 COMPLETE ‚Üí Proceed to Epic 3
  - **Savings:** 3-24 weeks avoided (Phase 2B/2C not needed)
  - **Cost Avoidance:** $18,000-$144,000

- **Acceptable Case (15% probability):** 65-70% accuracy
  - Need Stories 2.12-2.13 only (cross-encoder re-ranking)
  - **Additional:** 2-3 days
  - **Still better than:** Full Phase 2B (3-4 weeks)

- **Escalation Case (5% probability):** <65% accuracy
  - Proceed to full Phase 2B (3-4 weeks)
  - **Same outcome as:** Skipping course correction

**ROI:** 15:1 to 120:1 if course correction successful
