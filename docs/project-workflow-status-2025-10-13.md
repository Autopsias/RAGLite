## What to do next

**Recommended Next Action:** Implement Story 1.15A (HIGH) - PDF Ingestion Completion & Quick Diagnostic

**Current Context:** Story 1.15A is ready for implementation. This is a quick diagnostic story (1-1.5 hours) to complete PDF ingestion and identify root cause of 0% accuracy before full validation in Story 1.15.

**Story 1.15A Objectives:**
- ✅ Complete PDF ingestion for all 160 pages (currently pages 1-80 only)
- ✅ Run quick diagnostic on 0% accuracy (3-5 manual queries)
- ✅ Identify root cause category (test script vs. retrieval vs. keywords)
- ✅ Document findings and recommend fix approach for Story 1.15

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ Story 1.13 (page extraction fix) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Story 1.14 (NEW ground truth created) - COMPLETE
- ✅ Story context XML generated - COMPLETE

**Agent to load:** bmad/bmm/agents/dev.md (Dev Agent - Amelia)

**Command to run:** Run `dev-story` workflow to implement Story 1.15A
- `/docs/qa/epic-1-root-cause-analysis-20251013.md` - Complete investigation (345 lines)
- `/docs/stories/story-1.13.md` - Fix implementation story

**Next Steps:**
1. **Implement Story 1.13 (5-6 hours):**
   - Create `chunk_by_docling_items()` function with actual page extraction
   - Update `ingest_pdf()` to use new chunking
   - Add unit & integration tests
   - Clear Qdrant and re-ingest with fixed pipeline
2. **Re-Run Validation:**
   - Target: 95%+ attribution, 90%+ retrieval
   - Expected: HALT → GO decision
3. **Proceed to Phase 3** (if validation passes)

- **Next Action:** Story 1.15B complete and approved. Ready for Epic 2 implementation (Stories 2.1 + 2.2 in parallel as prioritized)

**2025-10-16 - Completed story-context for Story 1.15B (Baseline Validation & Analysis)**
- Generated by SM agent (Bob via Claude Code)
- **Context File:** `/docs/stories/story-context-1.1.15B.xml`
- **File Size:** Comprehensive (~300 lines XML)
- **Context Quality:** EXCELLENT
  - 5 tasks with 11 detailed subtasks (validate ingestion, run accuracy tests, analyze failures, benchmark performance, execute decision gate)
  - 5 acceptance criteria (including 2 CRITICAL: AC2 accuracy test suite, AC5 decision gate execution)
  - 6 documentation artifacts (Epic 1/2 PRDs, implementation plan, Stories 1.15/1.15A prerequisites, CLAUDE.md constraints)
  - 6 code artifacts (run-accuracy-tests.py, inspect-qdrant.py, accuracy_utils.py, ground_truth.py, source PDF)
  - 8 constraints (validation-only scope, Story 1.15 prerequisite, NFR6/NFR7/NFR13 targets, decision gate mandatory, expected baseline 50-70%)
  - 4 interfaces (run-accuracy-tests.py CLI, inspect-qdrant.py CLI, GROUND_TRUTH_QA data structure, accuracy_utils module)
  - Testing strategy with 9 test ideas (validation execution, analysis approach, decision gate logic)
  - 5 Python dependencies (pytest, qdrant-client, sentence-transformers, pydantic)
- **Key Focus:**
  - VALIDATION-ONLY story (1.5 hours) - NO code changes expected, focus on measurement and analysis
  - Task 1 (15min): Validate ingestion quality (300+ chunks, pages 1-160, table data searchable)
  - Task 2 (15min): Run full accuracy test suite (50 queries, measure retrieval %, attribution %, latency)
  - Task 3 (20min): Analyze failure patterns (categorize: keyword mismatch, table split, financial term, multi-hop)
  - Task 4 (10min): Performance benchmarking (p50/p95/p99 latency, chunk counts, latency budget)
  - Task 5 (5min): **DECISION GATE** - Determine Epic 2 need (Path 1: Skip / Path 2: Story 2.1 only / Path 3: Stories 2.1→2.3)
  - NFR6 target: ≥90% retrieval accuracy (baseline validation)
  - NFR7 target: ≥95% attribution accuracy (baseline validation)
  - NFR13 target: <10s p95 latency (performance validation)
  - Expected baseline: 50-70% accuracy after Story 1.15 table fix (realistic expectations for basic semantic search)
  - CRITICAL: AC5 (decision gate) is MANDATORY - cannot proceed without clear decision on Epic 2 need
- **Prerequisites:** Story 1.15 (Table Extraction Fix) MUST be complete before starting Story 1.15B
- **Deliverables:** 3 files to create (baseline-accuracy-report.txt, baseline-failure-analysis.md, baseline-performance-benchmarks.txt)
- **Story Reference Updated:** story-1.15B-baseline-validation.md now includes context reference link
- **Progress:** 95.5% → 96.0%
- **Next Action:** Complete Story 1.15 first (table extraction fix), then load DEV agent and run `dev-story` workflow to execute Story 1.15B validation

**2025-10-16 - Completed story-context for Story 1.15 (Table Extraction Fix)**
- Generated by SM agent (Bob via Claude Code)
- **Context File:** `/docs/stories/story-context-1.1.15.xml`
- **File Size:** Comprehensive (~278 lines XML)
- **Context Quality:** EXCELLENT
  - 4 acceptance criteria with implementation guidance (research table extraction, implement fix, re-ingest PDF, validate with diagnostics)
  - 4 task groups with detailed subtasks (research Docling capabilities, implement table extraction, re-ingest PDF with 300+ chunks, run 3 diagnostic queries)
  - 5 documentation artifacts (Epic 1 PRD, Story 1.15A root cause analysis, Story 1.13 implementation reference, Tech Stack table extraction options, CLAUDE.md constraints)
  - 6 code artifacts (pipeline.py chunk_by_docling_items/ingest_document, ingest-pdf.py, inspect-qdrant.py, ground_truth.py queries, source PDF)
  - 7 constraints (KISS principle, tech stack locked, follow Story 1.13 patterns, fix-only scope, AC3 mandatory, baseline 50-70% expected, manual validation required)
  - 5 interfaces (chunk_by_docling_items, DocumentConverter, ingest_document, ingest-pdf.py CLI, inspect-qdrant.py CLI)
  - Testing strategy with 9 test ideas (Docling research, page 46 testing, table extraction implementation, re-ingestion, verification, 3 diagnostic queries)
  - 5 Python dependencies (docling 2.55.1, pdfplumber/camelot-py optional alternatives, qdrant-client, pandas)
- **Key Focus:**
  - FIX story (2-3 hours) - table extraction ONLY, no refactoring
  - AC1 (1h): Research Docling table extraction capabilities, test on page 46
  - AC2 (1-1.5h): Configure Docling OR implement alternative extractor (pdfplumber/camelot)
  - AC3 (15-20min): Clear Qdrant (147 → 0), re-ingest with tables (expect 300+ chunks)
  - AC4 (30min): 3 diagnostic queries (Cost Q1, Margins Q13, Financial Q21) - expect pages 46, 77 in top-5
  - CRITICAL: Tech stack locked - must get approval before adding pdfplumber/camelot if Docling insufficient
  - ROOT CAUSE (from Story 1.15A): Docling extracts table headers/footnotes but NOT cell data - financial metrics missing
  - Expected baseline: 50-70% accuracy after fix (normal for this story, Story 1.15B will measure full accuracy)
- **Story Reference Updated:** story-1.15-table-extraction-fix.md now includes context reference link
- **Progress:** 95% → 95.5%
- **Next Action:** Load DEV agent and run `dev-story` workflow to implement Story 1.15 (table extraction fix)

**2025-10-16 - CORRECT-COURSE APPROVED - Epic 1 reorganization + Epic 2 added (conditional)**
- Completed `correct-course` workflow by SM agent (Bob via Claude Code)
- **Sprint Change Proposal:** Approved (batch mode review)
- **Trigger:** Story 1.15A identified critical table extraction failure
- **Changes Approved:**
  - ✅ Story 1.2: Added table extraction ACs (retroactive documentation)
  - ✅ Story 1.15: Redefined as table extraction fix (2-3 hours)
  - ✅ Story 1.15B: NEW baseline validation story (1.5 hours, decision gate)
  - ✅ Epic 2: NEW 6 RAG enhancement stories (CONDITIONAL on baseline <90%)
  - ✅ PRD: Created epic-2-advanced-rag-enhancements.md (6 stories, decision gates)
  - ✅ Architecture: Updated Phase 2 section (replaced GraphRAG with RAG enhancements)
- **Decision Gate Path (after Story 1.15B):**
  - IF ≥90% retrieval + ≥95% attribution → Epic 1 VALIDATED, skip Epic 2 ✅
  - IF 85-89% OR 93-94% → Implement Epic 2, Story 2.1 only (hybrid search) ⚠️
  - IF <85% OR <93% → Implement Epic 2, Stories 2.1 → 2.2 → 2.3 sequentially ✗
- **Timeline Impact:** 0-2 weeks (depends on baseline results)
- **Scope:** MODERATE (backlog reorganization + conditional Epic 2)
- **Documentation Updated:**
  - `docs/prd/epic-1-foundation-accurate-retrieval.md` - Story 1.2, 1.15, 1.15B, decision gate
  - `docs/prd/epic-2-advanced-rag-enhancements.md` - NEW FILE (6 stories, 2,850 lines)
  - `docs/architecture/8-phased-implementation-strategy-v11-simplified.md` - Phase 2 rewrite
  - `docs/project-workflow-status-2025-10-13.md` - Story queue, decisions log
- **Next Steps:**
  1. DEV agent: Implement Story 1.15 (table extraction fix, 2-3h)
  2. DEV agent: Execute Story 1.15B (baseline validation, 1.5h)
  3. Decision gate: Determine if Epic 2 needed
- **Progress:** 94.5% → 95%

**2025-10-14 - Story 1.15A COMPLETE - Root cause identified (table extraction failure)**
- Completed dev-story workflow for Story 1.15A (PDF Ingestion Completion & Quick Diagnostic)
- **All tasks complete:**
  - ✅ Task 1: PDF ingestion complete (147 points, pages 1-160, 16 min)
  - ✅ Task 2: Diagnostic tests complete (3 queries tested)
  - ✅ Task 3: Root cause identified (Docling table extraction failure)
- **Key findings:**
  - Whole PDF ingestion (160 pages) cleaner than split PDFs
  - Retrieval system working correctly (0.83-0.87 similarity scores)
  - **ROOT CAUSE:** Docling extracts table headers/footnotes but NOT table cell data
  - Financial metrics (costs, margins, EBITDA) stored in table cells are missing
  - 0% accuracy due to missing numerical data, not retrieval issues
- **Recommended fix for Story 1.15:**
  - Configure Docling table extraction OR use alternative method (pdfplumber, camelot)
  - Estimated effort: 2-3 hours (config + re-ingestion + validation)
- **Story status:** Ready for Review
- **Progress:** 93.5% → 94.5%
- **Next action:** Review Story 1.15A, then implement Story 1.15 with table extraction fix

  - Verify: ≥147 points in Qdrant (up from 73), page range 1-160, pages 46/47/77/108 indexed
  - Diagnose: Pattern A (keyword issue), Pattern B (retrieval issue), or Pattern C (critical failure)
  - Document: Ingestion stats, diagnostic results, root cause summary, recommended fix for Story 1.15
  - CRITICAL: AC1 (ingestion) is BLOCKING - cannot run diagnostics until complete
- **Purpose:** Quick prep work (1-1.5h) to unblock Story 1.15 full validation (2-3h)
- **Story Reference Updated:** story-1.15A.md now includes context reference link
- **Progress:** 93% → 93.5%
- **Next Action:** Load DEV agent and run `dev-story` workflow to implement Story 1.15A

- **Acceptance Criteria:** 4 (PDF ingestion completion, diagnostic testing, root cause identification, findings documentation)
- **Tasks:** 3 task groups with 10 subtasks
- **Key Focus:**
  - Task 1 (30-40min): Complete PDF ingestion for pages 81-160 (currently only 1-80 ingested)
  - Task 2 (20-30min): Quick diagnostic - test 3-5 queries manually to assess retrieval quality
  - Task 3 (10-15min): Root cause analysis - identify why accuracy is 0% (test script vs. retrieval vs. keywords)
  - Verify: ≥147 points in Qdrant (full 160-page PDF coverage)
  - Diagnose: Exact failure mode (keyword matching, wrong pages, or retrieval failure)
  - Document: Findings and recommended fix approach for Story 1.15
- **Purpose:** Unblock Story 1.15 by completing ingestion and providing root cause diagnosis before full validation effort
- **Relationship to Story 1.15:**
  - Story 1.15A: Quick prep work (complete ingestion, diagnose root cause) - 1-1.5h
  - Story 1.15: Full validation (fix issue, achieve NFR6/NFR7, sign off Epic 1) - 2-3h
- **Dependencies:** Story 1.14 (NEW ground truth created) ✓
- **Blocks:** Story 1.15 (needs complete ingestion and root cause clarity)
- **Progress:** 92.5% → 93%
- **Next Action:** Review story via `story-ready` workflow, then implement with DEV agent
