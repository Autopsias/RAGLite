# Sprint Change Proposal: Epic 2 Pivot to Element-Based RAG Enhancement

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Trigger:** Story 2.1 Failed AC6 Validation (56% vs ‚â•70% target)
**Analyst:** Scrum Master (Bob)
**Status:** ‚úÖ **APPROVED** by Ricardo (2025-10-18)
**Mode:** Batch Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

Story 2.1 (BM25 Hybrid Search) failed AC6 validation, achieving only **56% retrieval accuracy** against a ‚â•70% target. Root cause analysis revealed that **whitespace tokenization is fundamentally inadequate for financial documents** containing complex tables.

**DECISION:** PIVOT to element-based chunking approach with 3-phase sequential implementation:
1. **Story 2.2** (Element Chunking): 56% ‚Üí 64-68% (+8-12pp, 1 week, LOW risk)
2. **Story 2.3** (Query Preprocessing): 68% ‚Üí 74-76% (+6-8pp, 2 weeks, MEDIUM risk)
3. **Story 2.4** (Table Summarization): 74% ‚Üí 78-80% (+4-6pp, 3 weeks, MEDIUM risk)

**RECOMMENDATION:** ‚úÖ **APPROVED** - Research-backed, low-risk, incremental approach with decision gates

## 1. Issue Summary

### Triggering Story
Story 2.1 - Hybrid Search (BM25 + Semantic Fusion)

### Problem Statement
Story 2.1 (BM25 Hybrid Search) failed AC6 validation, achieving only **56% retrieval accuracy** against a ‚â•70% target. Root cause analysis revealed that **whitespace tokenization is fundamentally inadequate for financial documents** containing complex tables.

### Evidence
- ‚úÖ Implementation complete: 13 unit tests passing, 4 integration tests created
- ‚ùå Validation results (2025-10-18): 56.0% retrieval accuracy (UNCHANGED from baseline)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Attribution accuracy: 40.0% (+8pp improvement over 32% baseline, but insufficient)
- ‚úÖ Performance: p50=50ms, p95=90ms (within NFR13 <10,000ms limit)

### Root Cause (Technical)
1. **Number/Unit Tokenization**: "23.2 EUR/ton" splits incorrectly with whitespace tokenization
2. **Table Structure Destruction**: Markdown tables become linear token streams, losing semantic coherence
3. **Length Normalization Bias**: Short chunks (confidentiality notices) artificially inflate BM25 scores
4. **Financial Term Sensitivity**: "EBITDA" ‚â† "ebitda" ‚â† "Ebitda" breaks matching
5. **Low BM25 Coverage**: Most queries matched only 6-8% of documents (non-zero BM25 scores)

## 2. Epic & Artifact Impact Analysis

### Epic 2 Impact

**Can Epic 2 Be Completed As Planned?**
‚úÖ **YES** - with significant strategy pivot

**Required Modifications:**

| Component | Status | Change Required |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **OLD Story 2.1** (BM25 Hybrid Search) | ‚ùå FAILED | Mark as CLOSED/PIVOT with lessons learned |
| **OLD Story 2.2** (Financial Embeddings) | ‚è∏Ô∏è DEFERRED | Mark as CONDITIONAL (may revisit if element approach insufficient) |
| **NEW Story 2.2** (Element Chunking) | ‚úÖ DRAFTED | Implement as Phase 1 (56%‚Üí64-68%, 1 week, LOW risk) |
| **NEW Story 2.3** (Query Preprocessing) | üìã PLANNED | Implement as Phase 2 (68%‚Üí74-76%, 2 weeks, MEDIUM risk) |
| **NEW Story 2.4** (Table Summarization) | üìã PLANNED | Implement as Phase 3 (74%‚Üí78-80%, 3 weeks, MEDIUM risk) |

**Impact on Future Epics:**
- Epic 3 (Intelligence Features): ‚úÖ NOT affected - still depends on Epic 2 reaching ‚â•70%
- Epic 4 (Production Readiness): ‚úÖ NOT affected
- Epic 5 (Real-Time Operations): ‚úÖ NOT affected

**Epic Priority/Sequencing:** ‚úÖ UNCHANGED - Epic 2 remains Phase 2

### PRD Conflicts & Updates Required

**File:** `docs/prd/epic-2-advanced-rag-enhancements.md`

**Conflicts Identified:**
1. ‚ùå Story Descriptions Outdated (2.1, 2.2)
2. ‚ùå Expected Progression Mismatch (assumed 90%+, actual 56%)
3. ‚ùå Decision Gates Invalid (thresholds assume 90%+ start)
4. ‚úÖ Core Goals Still Valid (95-98% target, sequential implementation)

**PRD Updates Executed:**
- ‚úÖ Updated Expected Progression: 56% ‚Üí 64% ‚Üí 74% ‚Üí 78%
- ‚úÖ Updated Story 2.1: Added FAILED status with lessons learned
- ‚úÖ Replaced Story 2.2: Element-Based Chunking (was Financial Embeddings)
- ‚úÖ Added NEW Stories 2.3-2.4: Query Preprocessing + Table Summarization
- ‚úÖ Updated Decision Gates Summary: NEW vs OLD progression tables
- ‚úÖ Archived OLD Stories 2.3-2.6 as Phase 3+ conditional

### Architecture Document Impact

**Files:** `docs/architecture/*.md`

**Conflicts:** ‚úÖ **MINIMAL** - Changes are implementation details, not architectural

**Data Model Additions Required:**
```python
# raglite/shared/models.py (NEW)
class ElementType(str, Enum):
    TABLE = "table"
    SECTION_HEADER = "section_header"
    PARAGRAPH = "paragraph"
    LIST = "list"
    MIXED = "mixed"

@dataclass
class Chunk:
    # ... existing fields ...
    element_type: ElementType = ElementType.MIXED  # NEW
    section_title: Optional[str] = None            # NEW
    parent_chunk_id: Optional[str] = None         # NEW (for Story 2.4)
```

**Technology Stack Verification:**
- ‚úÖ Element chunking: Uses **Docling** (already approved)
- ‚úÖ Query preprocessing: **No new dependencies**
- ‚úÖ Table summarization: Uses **Claude 3.7 Sonnet API** (already approved)
- ‚úÖ **ZERO new dependencies** outside approved stack

---

## 3. Path Forward Evaluation

### Option 1: Direct Adjustment (Implement NEW Stories 2.2-2.4) ‚úÖ SELECTED

**Approach:** Add NEW element-based stories within Epic 2 structure

**Feasibility:** ‚úÖ **HIGHLY VIABLE**
- Timeline: 6 weeks (1 week + 2 weeks + 3 weeks)
- Effort: MEDIUM (well-scoped, research-backed)
- Risk: LOW-MEDIUM (Phase 1 is LOW, Phases 2-3 are MEDIUM)
- Maintains project momentum: Team pivots with clear direction

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Research-backed approach (Jimeno Yepes et al. 2024: +16pp page-level recall)
- ‚úÖ Leverages existing Docling infrastructure (minimal new code)
- ‚úÖ Incremental with decision gates (can stop early if targets met)
- ‚úÖ Technology stack compliant (ZERO new dependencies)
- ‚úÖ Clear success metrics at each phase

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 6-week timeline (vs original 4-6 hours for Story 2.1)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires comprehensive testing at each phase
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 3 (table summarization) has API costs (~$0.60/document)

### Option 2: Potential Rollback

**Status:** ‚ùå **NOT VIABLE** - Nothing to roll back (Story 2.1 is first Epic 2 story)

### Option 3: PRD MVP Review (Reduce Scope)

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL** - Can update PRD, but scope reduction NOT recommended
- ‚ùå Doesn't solve the fundamental problem (poor retrieval accuracy)
- ‚ùå Epic 3 (Intelligence Features) requires ‚â•70% accuracy to be useful
- ‚ùå Undermines project value proposition (accurate financial document RAG)

## 4. Recommended Path & Rationale

**Selected Approach:** **HYBRID of Option 1 + Option 3 (Documentation Update)**

**Execute:**
1. ‚úÖ Implement NEW Stories 2.2-2.4 (element-based chunking ‚Üí query preprocessing ‚Üí table summarization)
2. ‚úÖ Update Epic 2 PRD to document pivot and reset baseline expectations
3. ‚úÖ Maintain full accuracy targets (no scope reduction)

**Rationale:**

| Criterion | Assessment | Weight | Score |
|-----------|------------|--------|-------|
| **Research Evidence** | Strong empirical backing from 3 academic papers (2024-2025) | HIGH | 9/10 |
| **Technical Risk** | LOW for Phase 1, MEDIUM for Phases 2-3; manageable with decision gates | HIGH | 8/10 |
| **Implementation Effort** | 6 weeks total; incremental phases allow early exit if successful | MEDIUM | 7/10 |
| **Technology Stack Compliance** | Perfect - ZERO new dependencies, all within approved stack | HIGH | 10/10 |
| **Team Morale & Momentum** | Data-driven pivot shows professional decision-making | MEDIUM | 8/10 |
| **Business Value** | Clear path to 70%+ accuracy with high probability of success | HIGH | 9/10 |
| **Long-term Sustainability** | Element-based chunking is foundational - benefits ALL future work | HIGH | 9/10 |

**Weighted Score:** **8.7/10** (Strong recommendation)

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Academic Validation:** Jimeno Yepes et al. (2024) showed +16.3pp page-level recall with element-based chunking on SEC filings
2. **Industry Validation:** Kim et al. (ICLR 2025) achieved 56%‚Üí72% with retrieval optimization alone
3. **Financial Domain Fit:** Table-to-text summarization (Min et al. 2024) specifically addresses complex financial tables
4. **Incremental Risk Management:** 3-phase approach with decision gates allows early exit

## 6. PRD MVP Impact & Action Plan

### MVP Impact Assessment

**Q: Is the original PRD MVP still achievable?**

**A:** ‚úÖ **YES** - with adjusted timeline and strategy

**Original MVP Goal:**
- 90%+ retrieval accuracy (NFR6)
- 95%+ source attribution accuracy (NFR7)
- <10s query response time (NFR13)

**Reality Check:**
- Current baseline: 56% retrieval, 40% attribution
- Epic 2 (old plan): Assumed 90% starting point ‚Üí target 95%+
- Epic 2 (new plan): Starting from 56% ‚Üí target 70-80% ‚Üí continue if needed

**MVP Adjustment:**
- **Phase 1 Goal:** 70-80% accuracy (vs original 90%+)
- **Rationale:** 56% baseline reveals original assumptions were too optimistic
- **Decision:** If Stories 2.2-2.4 reach 78-80%, reassess if 90%+ is needed for MVP or can be deferred to Phase 3

**Timeline Impact:**
- **Original Epic 2:** 4-10 weeks (assumed 2-3 stories)
- **NEW Epic 2:** 6 weeks (3 stories √ó 1-3 weeks each)
- **Overall Project:** Still within Phase 2 scope (Weeks 5-12)
