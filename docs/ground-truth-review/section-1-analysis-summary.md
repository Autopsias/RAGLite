# Section 1 Data Inventory Analysis Summary
## Pages 1-20: SECIL Consolidated Performance Review - August 2025

**Review Date:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Confidence Level:** HIGH (85% estimated coverage)

---

## Executive Summary

Pages 1-20 of the SECIL financial report contain **13 distinct data tables** with comprehensive financial, operational, and safety metrics across 5 geographic regions (Portugal, Angola, Tunisia, Lebanon, Brazil).

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Page 20 contains a **TRANSPOSED TABLE** (cost per ton analysis) that requires Phase 2.7 extraction logic. All other tables (pages 1-19) use traditional structure suitable for Phase 2.6.

## Critical Findings

### 1. TRANSPOSED TABLE DETECTED (Page 20)
**Severity:** HIGH - Phase 2.7 REQUIRED

The Cost per Ton table uses **inverted structure**:
- **Rows:** Metrics (Sales Volumes, Variable Cost, Thermal Energy, etc.)
- **Columns:** Entities (Portugal Aug-25, Tunisia Aug-25, etc.)

**Traditional extraction logic WILL FAIL** on this table without Phase 2.7 transposed detection.

**Example Data:**
```
Portugal Aug-25: Variable Cost = -23.4 EUR/ton (actual)
Tunisia Aug-25:  Variable Cost = -29.1 EUR/ton (actual)
Lebanon Budget:  Fixed Cost = -15.6 EUR/ton
Brazil Aug-25:   Cement Unit EBITDA = 25.1 EUR/ton
```

### 2. Multi-Currency Complexity
Pages include exchange rate impacts with tracking of:
- EUR/AOA (Angola Kwanza)
- EUR/TND (Tunisian Dinar)
- EUR/USD (US Dollar)
- EUR/BRL (Brazilian Real)

Data presented in both local currency and EUR.

### 3. Hierarchical Entity Structure
Entities organized in parent-child relationships:
- Group (Total)
  - Portugal (region)
    - Portugal Cement (segment)
    - Portugal Ready Mix (segment)
    - etc.

Queries must disambiguate between consolidation levels.

### 4. Multiple Time Period Types
Requires robust period parsing:
- "Aug-25" = current month
- "YTD Aug-25" = year-to-date through August
- "B Aug-25" = budget for August
- "Aug-24" = last year August
- "Bdg 2025" = full year 2025 budget

## Ground Truth Query Framework

### Query Categories Recommended

**Point Queries (3)** - Easy
- Direct single-value lookups
- Example: "What is Group EBITDA in August 2025?"

**Comparison Queries (2)** - Medium
- Multi-entity analysis
- Example: "Compare variable costs between Portugal and Tunisia"

**Budget Variance Queries (2)** - Medium
- Actual vs Budget analysis
- Example: "How did EBITDA compare to budget?"

**Trend Queries (1)** - Hard
- Multi-period analysis
- Example: "What's the EBITDA trend from Aug-24 to Aug-25?"

**Calculation Queries (1)** - Hard
- Derived metrics
- Example: "What is the EBITDA margin %?"

**Transposed Table Queries (1)** - Hard
- Phase 2.7 specific
- Example: "What is Portugal's variable cost per ton?"

---

## Common Extraction Errors

### Traditional Tables (Pages 1-19)

1. **Period Confusion**
   - Using August month value instead of YTD
   - Confusing budget vs actual vs LY
   - Wrong comparison baseline

2. **Entity Disambiguation**
   - Wrong geographic region
   - Confusing parent/child levels
   - Intercompany elimination mishandling

3. **Column Header Parsing**
   - Complex nested headers (currency exchange)
   - Multiple period columns
   - Variance percentage columns

### Transposed Table (Page 20)

1. **Structure Not Detected**
   - Treating as traditional table
   - Rows/columns reversed
   - Metrics as column headers (wrong)

2. **Value Extraction**
   - Reading from wrong position
   - Currency unit confusion (EUR/ton vs LCU/ton)
   - Period misalignment

3. **Comparison Logic**
   - Failing to identify entity positions
   - Wrong delta calculations
   - Interpretation errors

## Phase Readiness Assessment

### Phase 2.6 (Fixed Chunking) - READY
- **Pages 1-19:** All tables use traditional structure
- **Expected Performance:** Should work correctly with proper header parsing
- **Key Tables:** Financial indicators, P&L, Turnover, EBITDA, CAPEX

### Phase 2.7 (Transposed Detection) - REQUIRED
- **Page 20:** Cost per Ton table uses inverted structure
- **Expected Performance:** WILL FAIL without transposed detection
- **Criticality:** Must implement before Section 1 queries fully supported

### Overall Status
```
Phase 2.6 Ready for: Pages 1-19 (92% of content)
Phase 2.7 Required for: Page 20 (8% of content, but critical for cost analysis)
```

## Data Quality Assessment

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|--|--|--|
| Header Clarity | **HIGH** | Clear table titles and column labels |
| Data Consistency | **HIGH** | Uniform formatting, consistent units |
| Completeness | **HIGH** | No major missing sections |
| Complexity | **MEDIUM-HIGH** | Hierarchical structure, multiple periods |
| Transposed Detection | **CRITICAL** | Page 20 not detectable by Phase 2.6 |

   - Validate against extracted data
   - Document expected answers

5. **Review Section 2 (Pages 21-40)**
   - Identify additional tables
   - Check for more transposed tables
   - Continue inventory
