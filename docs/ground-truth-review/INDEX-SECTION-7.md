## Integration Guide

### For RAG Ground Truth Database

1. **Import YAML structure** into ground truth store
2. **Validate queries** against actual retrieval system
3. **Track accuracy** by:
   - Overall: % correct answers
   - By difficulty: Easy (100%), Medium (85%), Hard (70%) targets
   - By category: Volume, Cost, Profitability, Efficiency, Safety, WC
4. **Analyze failures** using challenge patterns from Summary
5. **Iterate** on chunking/indexing based on failure analysis

### For RAG System Design

1. **Review challenges** section for known failure modes
2. **Configure multi-table linking** for cross-reference queries
3. **Implement semantic understanding** for variance direction
4. **Handle mixed units** with explicit unit tracking
5. **Support hierarchical aggregation** for segment roll-ups
6. **Validate sign handling** for negative values

### For Testing Reports

1. **Track accuracy by difficulty** (Easy, Medium, Hard)
2. **Monitor by dimension** (volume, cost, profitability, etc)
3. **Identify failure patterns** (which challenges most common)
4. **Compare to baselines** (expected vs actual performance)
5. **Document improvements** (iterations and fixes applied)

## Data Quality Summary

### Strengths
✓ Consistent table structure (all non-transposed)
✓ Complete variance context (95% of metrics)
✓ Clear data attribution (100% traceable)
✓ Realistic business scenarios (losses, inefficiencies)
✓ Multi-dimensional coverage (7+ functional areas)

### Limitations
- Sparse health & safety data (2 months vs 12 months)
- Complex hierarchies (may confuse simple systems)
- Mixed units across metrics (requires careful handling)
- Negative value conventions (requires interpretation)
- Cross-table inference needed for most hard queries
