## Critical Findings & Alerts

### Performance Concerns
1. **Ready Mix EBITDA:** Down 52% (-207 to 188) despite stable pricing - volume weakness
2. **H&S Performance:** Significantly above budget across both regions
3. **G&A Headcount:** 126 actual vs 65 budgeted (94% overspend)
4. **EU Market:** Declining volume (-43%) and pricing (-15%)

### Positive Developments
1. **Libya Export:** Exceptional performance (+120% revenue, +112% volume)
2. **Cement Production:** +15% above budget (780 kton)
3. **Cost Control:** Variable costs -3%, Energy costs -11% favorable
4. **Cash Generation:** +2.3M net cash flow vs budgeted deficit
5. **Debt Reduction:** 2.3M reduction in YTD period

### Operational Anomalies
- Headcount spike in June 2025 (581 vs normal ~280-300) suggests temporary workforce event
- G&A travel variance of +27411% (likely data entry anomaly)
- Missing H&S data for some months (Jan-Mar, Jun, Sep-Dec)

## Data Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- **Consistency:** Four-way comparison (Month/YTD/Budget/Prior Year) enables robust validation
- **Completeness:** Full P&L, balance sheet, and cash flow coverage
- **Granularity:** Product-line, geographic, and market-level segmentation
- **Time Series:** Historical data 2020-2025 for trend analysis
- **Context:** Clear unit specifications and calculation formulas

### Known Challenges
- **Budget Anomalies:** Some extreme variances suggest data quality issues
- **Missing Data:** H&S metrics have gaps in monthly reporting
- **Currency Mix:** TND and USD mix requires careful handling in queries
- **Visual Charts:** Lebanon EBITDA Bridge is waterfall visualization (requires interpretation)
- **Negative Values:** Costs shown in parentheses need special handling

### Recommendations
- Validate extreme variances (e.g., travel expense +27411%)
- Interpolate missing H&S data points for trend analysis
- Create currency context labels for all international queries
- Document waterfall chart logic for Lebanon analysis
- Standardize cost value handling (parentheses vs negative sign)

## Using This Inventory for RAG Systems

### Data Ingestion
1. **Chunking:** Split by table sections (e.g., Internal Market, External Market, Costs)
2. **Chunk Size:** 512 tokens optimal for retrieval
3. **Metadata:** Include (period, currency, division, region) in every chunk
4. **Deduplication:** Handle multi-referenced metrics across tables

### Entity Extraction
**Required Entities:**
- Geographic: Tunisia, Lebanon, Libya, EU
- Products: Cement, Ready-Mix, Clinker
- Divisions: Cement, Building Materials, G&A
- Time Periods: Aug-2025, YTD 2025, Budget 2025, FY 2024

**Optional Enrichment:**
- Product variants (Grey Bulk, Grey Bagged, White Cement)
- Cost categories (Thermal, Electrical, Labor, Raw Materials)
- Market segments (Internal, Libya, EU, Other)

### Query Optimization
**Always Require in Query:**
- Time period specification
- Geographic region or company division
- Specific metric name or category

**Handle Special Cases:**
- Currency conversion for TND/USD comparisons
- Budget variance calculations (always specify baseline)
- Ratio calculations (DSO, DIO, DPO, Margins)
- Trend analysis (multi-year comparisons)
