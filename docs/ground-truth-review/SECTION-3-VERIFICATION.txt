================================================================================
DATA QUALITY FINDINGS
================================================================================

PARSING CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED:

1. TRANSPOSED TABLE (T3-002 - Headcount Evolution)
   Impact: Medium
   Severity: High (breaks standard parsers)
   Recommendation: Implement timeline-aware parsing
   Test Case: GTQ-3-002

2. MULTI-LEVEL HEADERS (T3-003 Capex, T3-005 Operational Costs)
   Impact: Medium
   Severity: Medium (complex cell-to-header mapping)
   Recommendation: Careful header hierarchy mapping
   Test Cases: GTQ-3-003, GTQ-3-006, GTQ-3-011

3. PERCENTAGE NOTATION VARIABILITY
   Impact: Low
   Severity: Low (interpretability)
   Variations: %, pp (basis points), decimal
   Example: 36.0%, -0.5 pp, 56
   Recommendation: Normalize to consistent format

4. UNIT CONVERSIONS REQUIRED
   Impact: Medium
   Severity: Medium (calculation accuracy)
   Examples:
   - Volume: km³ (1M m³), kton (1000 ton)
   - Energy: Kcal/kg, Kwh/ton
   - Currency: EUR (thousands)
   Recommendation: Track units throughout pipeline

5. NEGATIVE VALUE INTERPRETATION
   Impact: Medium
   Severity: Medium (semantic understanding)
   Examples:
   - Costs shown as negative: -77.1 EUR/m³
   - Variance shown as negative: -37%
   - EBITDA calculation requires subtraction
   Recommendation: Document semantic meaning of negatives

================================================================================
SEMANTIC CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

Test cases mapped to specific semantic challenges:

CHALLENGE 1: Transposed Table Parsing
- Identifies timeline-oriented table structure
- Test: GTQ-3-002 (Headcount comparison)

CHALLENGE 2: Negative Value Interpretation
- Requires understanding costs as negative deductions
- Tests: GTQ-3-010 (Cost structure), GTQ-3-011 (Variance)

CHALLENGE 3: Derived Metrics Calculation
- EBITDA = Price - Variable Cost - Fixed Cost
- Tests: GTQ-3-009 (Margin), GTQ-3-014 (Plant EBITDA)

CHALLENGE 4: Cross-Entity Aggregation
- Regional volumes sum to consolidated total
- Test: GTQ-3-015 (Total volume aggregation)

CHALLENGE 5: Budget Variance Analysis
- Percentage variance vs absolute variance
- Tests: GTQ-3-003 (Capex variance), GTQ-3-011 (Cost variance)

CHALLENGE 6: Scale Economics Understanding
- Unit cost varies by scale despite same pricing
- Tests: GTQ-3-006 (Plant unit cost), GTQ-3-014 (Plant EBITDA)

================================================================================
