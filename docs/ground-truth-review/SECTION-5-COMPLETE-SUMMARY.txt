KEY FINDINGS & INSIGHTS
================================================================================

ANGOLA PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:
- EBITDA under pressure: 282.2M AOA YTD (-46% vs budget, flat vs prior)
- Strong pricing (+55% YoY) offset by volume declines and cost inflation
- Inventory crisis: 166 days on hand (5.5 months), consuming 15% of turnover
- Positive cash flow generation (1.26B) masks working capital deterioration
- Headcount lean: -12% understaffed vs budget (83 vs 94 FTEs)
- Safety KPIs not tracked (blank data through full period)

TUNISIA PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:
- Exceptional growth: EBITDA up 128% to 38.7M TND YTD
- Margin expansion: +8 percentage points to 22.2%
- Volume growth: +13% YTD, +498% in Libya exports (major opportunity)
- Cost control: Variable costs down 16% despite inflation
- Safety alert: Frequency ratio 3.66 (205% over budget) - CRITICAL
- Strong production: 406 kton YTD vs 358 prior year

CRITICAL MANAGEMENT ALERTS:
1. Angola Working Capital: Inventory buildupRequires immediate normalization
2. Tunisia Safety: Frequency ratio critically elevated - program review needed
3. Cash Flow Variance: 3.4B AOA swing unexplained - analyst review required
4. Budget Credibility: FY2025 budget process shows significant weakness
