================================================================================
GROUND TRUTH QUERIES PROVIDED (15 TOTAL)
================================================================================

EASY DIFFICULTY (3 queries):
- Query 1: Volume metrics for cement (single metric)
- Query 5: Headcount snapshot (single metric)
- Query 13: Safety frequency ratio (single metric)

MEDIUM DIFFICULTY (7 queries):
- Query 2: Price trends year-over-year
- Query 4: Profitability margins and comparisons
- Query 8: Energy efficiency metrics and trends
- Query 9: Days sales outstanding (DSO) metric
- Query 14: Market share and market growth
- Plus 2 additional medium queries

HARD DIFFICULTY (5 queries):
- Query 3: Cost structure breakdown with variance analysis
- Query 6: Segment performance analysis
- Query 7: G&A cost ratios and trends
- Query 11: Cost component percentages
- Query 15: Inventory levels and working capital days

Each query includes:
- Natural language question
- Expected answer with source data
- Source table reference
- Difficulty level classification
- Answer type (numeric, trend, ratio, etc.)

================================================================================
RETRIEVAL CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

Challenge 1: Multi-Table Cross-References
Example: Query 11 requires data from both Table 1 and Table 10
Risk: System may retrieve only one table if not configured for linking

Challenge 2: Variance Direction Interpretation
Example: 14% variable cost variance is NEGATIVE (cost overrun), not positive
Risk: Requires semantic understanding of favorable vs. unfavorable variance

Challenge 3: Unit Consistency
Issue: Mixed units across tables (1000 USD, USD/ton, kton, km³, LBP, BRL)
Risk: Unit confusion if extraction fails or mixes units in comparisons

Challenge 4: Implicit Hierarchies
Example: Ready-Mix and Precast are sub-components of Materials segment
Risk: Aggregation errors if system doesn't understand component relationships

Challenge 5: Negative Value Handling
Issue: All costs shown as negative (-1058, -462, etc.)
Risk: Sign interpretation errors in retrieval and synthesis

Challenge 6: Percentage vs. Percentage Points
Issue: Margin variance in percentage points (-2 pp), ratio variance in percent (+24%)
Risk: Unit confusion if not carefully distinguished

Challenge 7: Market Context Integration
Example: Cement volume +24% but price flat, why? Answer requires market data
Risk: System must integrate market context from detailed operations table

ANALYSIS RESULTS
================================================================================

Table Structure Quality:       EXCELLENT (non-transposed, consistent)
Data Completeness:             GOOD (88% of metrics with full data)
Variance Context:              EXCELLENT (95% have budget/LY comparisons)
Attribution Clarity:           EXCELLENT (every number source identified)
Retrieval Test Coverage:       COMPREHENSIVE (easy to hard across 7 dimensions)
Real Business Complexity:      HIGH (negative margins, inventory bloat, safety issues)

Recommended Test Progression:
1. Start with Easy queries (single metrics from Table 1 or 8)
2. Progress to Medium queries (2-3 metrics, same table)
3. Advance to Hard queries (cross-table, semantic understanding)

Key Strengths for Ground Truth:
- Consistent structure enables systematic testing
- Rich variance context (Budget, LY, Month/YTD)
- Multi-dimensional data (volume, price, cost, efficiency, safety)
- Clear source attribution for accuracy validation
- Realistic business scenarios (volatility, losses, inefficiencies)

Potential Weaknesses for Ground Truth:
- Some metrics have sparse data (Health & Safety only 2 months reported)
- Complex hierarchies may confuse simple retrieval systems
- Negative values and mixed units require careful handling
- Cross-table inference needed for most Hard queries

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

For Ground Truth Creation:
1. Use Easy queries to validate basic metric retrieval
2. Use Medium queries to test metric combinations and context
3. Use Hard queries to test semantic understanding and cross-table synthesis
4. Validate number accuracy within 1% tolerance
5. Check source attribution (table, page, column) exactly

For RAG System Tuning:
1. Test handling of mixed units and currencies
2. Test understanding of favorable vs. unfavorable variance
3. Test hierarchical segment aggregation (Cement + Ready-Mix + Precast = Total)
4. Test cross-table linking for multi-metric queries
5. Test negative value handling in cost/benefit calculations

For Retrieval Validation:
1. Establish baseline accuracy on Easy queries (target: 100%)
2. Measure Medium query accuracy (target: 85%+)
3. Measure Hard query accuracy (target: 70%+)
4. Identify failure patterns (units, hierarchies, cross-refs)
5. Iterate on chunking/indexing strategy based on failure analysis
