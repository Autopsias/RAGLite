## Quick Start

### For Analysis Teams
1. Read: **section-1-analysis-summary.md**
2. Review: Section insights, critical findings, phase readiness
3. Reference: Common extraction errors section

### For Extraction Engineers
1. Review: **section-1-inventory.yaml** - table metadata
2. Reference: **section-1-quick-reference.md** - extraction patterns
3. Validate: Against 15 sample values and 10 test queries

### For Data Scientists
1. Study: **section-1-inventory.yaml** - complete query framework
2. Analyze: 10 ground truth queries with expected answers
3. Test: Phase 2.6 and Phase 2.7 extraction performance

---

## Critical Alerts

### TRANSPOSED TABLE DETECTED (Page 20)
```
Table:    Cost per Ton Analysis
Location: Page 20
Structure: METRICS IN ROWS, ENTITIES IN COLUMNS
Impact:   Phase 2.6 extraction WILL FAIL
Solution: Requires Phase 2.7 transposed detection logic

Example:
  Row Labels: Sales Volumes, Variable Cost, Fixed Cost, etc.
  Column Headers: Portugal Aug-25, Tunisia Aug-25, Lebanon Aug-25, Brazil Aug-25
  Data: Portugal Variable Cost = -23.4 EUR/ton
```

### Multi-Currency Complexity
- Data presented in EUR and local currency (LCU)
- Exchange rate impacts tracked separately
- Must disambiguate currency in queries
- Conversion factors: EUR/AOA, EUR/TND, EUR/USD, EUR/BRL

### Entity Hierarchy
- Consolidated Group (all regions)
- Geographic Region (Portugal, Angola, Tunisia, Lebanon, Brazil)
- Business Segment (Cement, Ready-Mix, Aggregates, Mortars, etc.)
- 22+ sub-entities requiring disambiguation
