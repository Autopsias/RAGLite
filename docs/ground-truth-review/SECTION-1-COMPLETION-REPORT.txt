================================================================================
CRITICAL FINDINGS
================================================================================

CRITICAL ISSUE #1: TRANSPOSED TABLE (Page 20)
Severity: HIGH - Phase 2.7 REQUIRED
Impact:   Phase 2.6 extraction will FAIL on this table
Structure: Metrics in rows, Entities in columns (inverted)
Example:  Variable Cost row × Portugal, Tunisia, Lebanon, Brazil columns
Solution: Phase 2.7 transposed table detection logic required

ISSUE #2: Multi-Currency Complexity
Severity: MEDIUM
Data:     EUR and local currency (AOA, TND, USD, BRL) both presented
Exchange: Rates tracked separately with impacts documented
Handling: Must disambiguate currency in queries
Impact:   Medium-high extraction difficulty

ISSUE #3: Entity Hierarchy
Severity: MEDIUM
Levels:   Consolidated → Region → Segment → Sub-entity
Risks:    Wrong hierarchy level, intercompany eliminations
Handling: Clear entity context in queries required

ISSUE #4: Period Ambiguity
Severity: MEDIUM
Types:    Month, YTD, Budget, LY, Forecast, Historical
Risk:     Using wrong period (month vs YTD most common)
Handling: Explicit period specification required

================================================================================
PHASE READINESS ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

PHASE 2.6 (Fixed 512-Token Chunking):
  Status:     READY for Pages 1-19
  Coverage:   92% of Section 1 content
  Tables:     12 traditional tables
  Expected:   High accuracy (85%+)
  Key Tables: Financial Indicators, P&L, Turnover, EBITDA

PHASE 2.7 (Transposed Table Detection):
  Status:     REQUIRED for Page 20
  Coverage:   8% of Section 1 content (but critical)
  Tables:     1 transposed table (Cost per Ton)
  Expected:   Medium accuracy (60%+ without optimization)
  Critical:   All cost-per-ton queries depend on this

OVERALL READINESS:
  Current:    92% coverage achievable with Phase 2.6
  Full:       100% coverage requires Phase 2.7
  Priority:   Phase 2.7 implementation high priority

  2. Measure baseline accuracy on 5 easy queries
  3. Identify failure modes in complex tables
  4. Document extraction patterns and challenges

MEDIUM-TERM (Phase 2.7 Implementation):
  1. Implement transposed table detection logic
  2. Validate on page 20 cost-per-ton data
  3. Test all transposed-specific queries
  4. Achieve 85%+ accuracy on full section

LONG-TERM (Validation & Extension):
  1. Run all 10 ground truth queries for validation
  2. Document accuracy metrics and failure patterns
  3. Proceed to Section 2 (Pages 21-40)
