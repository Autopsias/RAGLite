## Readiness Assessment

### BMAD Workflow Compliance

| **Checklist Category** | **Before Sprint** | **After Sprint** | **Improvement** |
|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Product Context | 80% | 95% | +15% |
| Problem Definition | 85% | 95% | +10% |
| Solution Approach | 60% | 90% | +30% |
| User Experience | 75% | 85% | +10% |
| Architecture Cohesion | 65% | 92% | +27% |
| Technical Feasibility | 80% | 95% | +15% |
| Risk Assessment | 70% | 90% | +20% |
| Implementation Planning | 70% | 95% | +25% |
| **OVERALL SCORE** | **75/100** | **95/100** | **+20 points** |

### Readiness by Phase

| **Phase** | **Readiness Score** | **Status** | **Blockers** |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|--------------|
| Phase 1 (Weeks 1-5) | 95/100 | ✅ **READY** | None (Story 1.2 can proceed) |
| Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8) | 90/100 | ✅ READY (if triggered) | Conditional on Phase 1 decision gate |
| Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12) | 75/100 | ⚠️ READY (with caveat) | Epic 3 architecture design needed (5-7 days) |
| Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16) | 95/100 | ✅ READY | None (can proceed after Phase 3) |

**Overall Assessment:** RAGLite is **READY** for Phase 1 implementation. Phase 3 requires architecture design sprint but does NOT block earlier phases.

---

## Key Findings & Recommendations

### 1. Phase 1 Critical Path is Clear

**Status:** ✅ READY TO PROCEED

**Evidence:**
- Tech Spec Epic 1 provides 500-line detailed implementation guide
- Week-by-week timeline defined (Week 0 spike complete → Weeks 1-5)
- Story 1.2 (PDF ingestion) has complete requirements and diagnostic script available
- All Phase 1 dependencies resolved (Story 1.1 complete, Qdrant running, API keys configured)

**Recommendation:** **Commence Phase 1 Week 1 (Story 1.2: PDF Document Ingestion) immediately.**

---

### 2. Epic 3 Architecture Gap Requires Proactive Resolution

**Status:** ⚠️ BLOCKER DOCUMENTED (Resolution Path Defined)

**Issue:** Framework selection for agentic orchestration not yet completed (LangGraph vs AWS Bedrock Agents vs native function calling).

**Impact:**
- **NO IMPACT** on Phase 1-2 (can proceed independently)
- **BLOCKS** Epic 3 story creation (cannot write acceptance criteria without framework)
- **Estimated Delay:** 1-2 weeks if not addressed proactively

**Recommendation:**
1. **Schedule architecture design sprint AFTER Phase 1 decision gate (Week 5)**
2. Architect performs 5-7 day evaluation (research spike + POC + design doc)
3. User approves framework selection by end of Week 6
4. Tech Spec Epic 3 updated with framework-specific details
5. Phase 3 implementation proceeds Week 9 (or 5 if Phase 2 skipped)

**Mitigation:** This is a known, documented blocker with clear resolution path. Not a surprise delay.

---

### 3. Technology Stack Validated & Locked

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Evidence:**
- All 40 dependencies pinned with specific versions
- Week 0 spike validated tech stack feasibility (60% accuracy, high semantic similarity)
- No "Latest" or "TBD" entries remaining

**Recommendation:** **NO changes to technology stack without user approval.** Tech stack is LOCKED per CLAUDE.md anti-over-engineering rules.

---

### 4. Documentation Quality is Excellent

**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED

**Metrics:**
- Cohesion score: 92/100 (excellent architecture-requirements coverage)
- Epic alignment matrix: Complete traceability for all 5 epics
- Tech specs: Comprehensive implementation guidance (Epic 1-5 covered)
- Validation report: 71 checklist items evaluated (75% → 95% readiness)

**Finding:** RAGLite documentation suite is now **BMAD-compliant** and **immediately usable** for development.

---

### 5. Phased Implementation Strategy is Sound

**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED

**Evidence:**
- Project Workflow Analysis (Level 2 formal assessment) justifies monolithic MVP approach
- Week 0 spike report validates technology choices (GO decision for Phase 1)
- Conditional Phase 2 (GraphRAG) approach de-risks investment
- Phased NFR validation gates prevent accumulation of technical debt

**Recommendation:** **Proceed with phased strategy as documented.** No changes needed.
