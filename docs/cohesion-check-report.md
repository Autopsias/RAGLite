## 6. Vagueness Detection

### Areas Lacking Specification

**1. Epic 3: AI Intelligence & Orchestration (HIGH SEVERITY)**

**Issue:** No architecture specification for agentic workflows

**Vague Areas:**
- Framework selection: "LangGraph/Bedrock/function calling per research spike" *(PENDING RESEARCH SPIKE)*
- Agent definitions: No specialized agent specifications
- Orchestration patterns: No workflow execution design
- State management: No approach specified
- Error handling: No fallback strategies documented

**Impact:** Blocks Phase 3 Epic 3 implementation (FR14-FR17, NFR5)

**Evidence:**
- `PRD/requirements.md:FR14`: "agentic framework (LangGraph/Bedrock/function calling per research spike)"
- `PRD/epic-3-ai-intelligence-orchestration.md`: Epic goal defined but no architecture

**Recommendation:** Complete Epic 3 architecture design:
1. **Research Spike:** Evaluate LangGraph vs AWS Bedrock Agents vs direct function calling
2. **Architecture Design:** Agent types, orchestration patterns, state management
3. **Create Tech Spec:** `docs/tech-spec-epic-3.md` with detailed design
4. **Target Completion:** Before Phase 3 start (after Phase 1 Week 5 validation)

---

**2. Testing Infrastructure Details (MEDIUM SEVERITY)**

**Issue:** Test strategy documented but project-specific details missing

**Vague Areas:**
- Ground truth test set: 15 queries in spike, expanding to 50+ (format/structure not specified)
- Accuracy measurement methodology: Manual validation vs automated metrics
- Test data fixtures: No sample documents specified for testing
- Performance regression tests: Targets defined but test implementation unclear

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Story 1.12A will address (Week 1 planned)

**Evidence:**
- `arch/testing-strategy.md`: Template examples, not project-specific tests
- `PRD/epic-1:328-359`: Story 1.12A creates 50+ query test set (planned Week 1)

**Recommendation:** Story 1.12A (Week 1) will resolve - ensure comprehensive test documentation.

---

### Vagueness Summary

| Area | Severity | Impact | Status | Resolution Plan |
|------|----------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Epic 3 Architecture | HIGH | Blocks Phase 3 Epic 3 | PENDING | Research spike + architecture design before Phase 3 |
| Testing Infrastructure | MEDIUM | Blocks Story 1.12A | PLANNED | Story 1.12A (Week 1) resolves |

**Overall Vagueness Score:** 94% specific (2 areas identified out of ~30 architecture sections)

**Analysis:** Architecture emphasizes simplicity and anti-over-engineering. Checked for premature optimization, unnecessary abstractions, and over-documentation.

**Findings:**

**1. Documentation Volume (LOW CONCERN)**

**Observation:** 30 architecture files + 13 PRD files (43 documents total)

**Assessment:**
- ✅ **Justified:** Sharded structure improves navigability for large architecture
- ✅ **Necessary:** Each file serves specific purpose (vision, tech stack, deployment, etc.)
- ✅ **Anti-Pattern Mitigation:** Detailed planning enables simple implementation (600-800 lines)

**Verdict:** NOT over-specification - comprehensive planning prevents over-engineering implementation

---

**2. NFR Count (LOW CONCERN)**

**Observation:** 32 Non-Functional Requirements (high number)

**Assessment:**
- ✅ **Justified:** Covers critical domains (performance, security, scalability, reliability)
- ✅ **Quantitative:** Most NFRs have measurable targets (90%+ accuracy, <5s retrieval)
- ✅ **Traceable:** All NFRs map to architecture components

**Verdict:** NOT over-specification - comprehensive NFRs ensure quality gates

---

**3. Specialist Sections (LOW CONCERN)**

**Observation:** Separate detailed docs for security, monitoring, testing, CI/CD

**Assessment:**
- ✅ **Phase-Appropriate:** MVP uses simplified versions (Docker Compose, GitHub Actions)
- ✅ **Future-Ready:** Phase 4 needs comprehensive security/monitoring (planned, not implemented)
- ✅ **Graceful Scaling:** Architecture allows MVP start with full production path documented

**Verdict:** NOT over-specification - detailed planning for Phase 4, simple implementation for MVP

---

### Over-Specification Summary

**Findings:** 0 cases of actual over-specification detected

**Architecture Philosophy:**
- ✅ Detailed **planning** (comprehensive docs)
- ✅ Simple **implementation** (600-800 lines, monolithic)
- ✅ Anti-over-engineering rules enforced (CLAUDE.md:20-60)

**Balance Assessment:** ✅ EXCELLENT - Thorough planning enables minimal implementation

## 8. Gaps and Recommendations

### Critical Gaps (Must Address)

#### Gap 1: Epic 3 Architecture Specification (HIGH)

**Issue:** Agentic workflows lack detailed architecture design

**Impact:**
- Blocks FR14-FR17 implementation
- Blocks NFR5 validation
- Prevents Phase 3 Epic 3 planning

**Recommendation:**
1. **Research Spike (2-3 days):**
   - Evaluate LangGraph: Agent framework with state graphs
   - Evaluate AWS Bedrock Agents: Managed agentic service
   - Evaluate Direct Function Calling: Claude API native approach
   - **Deliverable:** Framework comparison matrix with recommendation

2. **Architecture Design (3-4 days):**
   - Define agent types (retrieval, analysis, forecasting, synthesis)
   - Specify orchestration patterns (sequential, parallel, conditional)
   - Design state management (in-memory for MVP, persistent for Phase 4)
   - Document error handling and graceful degradation
   - **Deliverable:** Epic 3 architecture section + tech spec

3. **Timeline:** Before Phase 3 start (after Phase 1 Week 5 validation)

**Estimated Effort:** 5-7 days total

---

#### Gap 2: Tech Spec Documents Missing (HIGH)

**Issue:** No per-epic technical specifications for implementation

**Impact:**
- Developers lack detailed implementation guidance
- No component-level specifications
- Testing requirements not formalized per epic

**Recommendation:**
Create tech specs prioritized:

**Phase 1 (Immediate):**
- `docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md` (3-4 hours)
  - Component specifications (ingestion, retrieval, MCP server, shared)
  - API contracts (Pydantic models)
  - Testing requirements (unit, integration, accuracy)
  - NFR validation criteria (NFR6, NFR7, NFR13)

**Phase 3 Planning:**
- `docs/tech-spec-epic-4.md` (2-3 hours)
  - Forecasting implementation (Prophet + LLM)
  - Insights generation (anomalies, trends)
  - NFR validation (NFR10)

**Phase 4 Planning:**
- `docs/tech-spec-epic-5.md` (2-3 hours)
  - AWS infrastructure (ECS, S3, CloudWatch)
  - CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions → AWS)
  - Monitoring integration (CloudWatch, Prometheus)

**Conditional (Phase 2):**
- `docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md` (2-3 hours)
  - IF Phase 1 accuracy <80%
  - Neo4j integration, hybrid retrieval

**Future (Phase 3):**
- `docs/tech-spec-epic-3.md` (3-4 hours)
  - AFTER Epic 3 architecture complete
  - Agentic workflow implementation

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours (Epic 1), 13-17 hours (all epics)

---

#### Gap 3: Cohesion Check Report Missing (HIGH)

**Issue:** No formal validation of architecture-to-requirements coverage (RESOLVED by this document)

**Impact:** Cannot verify all PRD requirements addressed by architecture

**Recommendation:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - This document serves as the cohesion check report

---

#### Gap 4: Epic Alignment Matrix Missing (HIGH)

**Issue:** No formal epic-to-component traceability matrix

**Impact:** Developers lack clear epic-to-file mapping

**Recommendation:**
Create `docs/epic-alignment-matrix.md` (1-2 hours) with:
- Epic-to-component mapping
- File-level traceability
- Dependency graph
- Phase alignment

**Status:** PENDING (addressed in Section 3 above, formal document needed)

---

### Medium Gaps (Should Address)

#### Gap 5: Technology Version Pinning (MEDIUM)

**Issue:** 3 technologies use "Latest" instead of specific versions

**Impact:** Reproducibility risk, potential dependency conflicts

**Recommendation:**
Update `docs/architecture/5-technology-stack-definitive.md` (30 minutes):
- Docling: 2.55.1 (from spike/requirements.txt)
- sentence-transformers: 5.1.1 (Fin-E5)
- openpyxl + pandas: [extract exact versions from pyproject.toml]
- pytest + pytest-asyncio: [extract exact versions]

**Estimated Effort:** 30 minutes

---

#### Gap 6: PRD Change Log Missing (MEDIUM)

**Issue:** No formal tracking of PRD updates driven by architectural discoveries

**Impact:** Requirement traceability incomplete

**Recommendation:**
Create `docs/prd/change-log.md` (30 minutes) documenting:
- Story 1.2: Enhanced with page extraction ACs (Week 0 finding)
- Story 1.4: Added page preservation ACs (Week 0 finding)
- Story 1.11: Architecture change (MCP response format vs LLM synthesis)

**Estimated Effort:** 30 minutes

---

### Low Priority Gaps (Consider)

#### Gap 7: Project Workflow Analysis Missing (LOW)

**Issue:** No standard `project-workflow-analysis.md` with project level determination

**Impact:** BMAD standard compliance (non-critical)

**Recommendation:**
Create `docs/project-workflow-analysis.md` (1 hour) retroactively:
- Project level: 2 (monolithic MVP, 600-800 lines, 5 weeks)
- Complexity assessment: Medium
- Technology validation: Week 0 spike
- Reference to sharded architecture docs

**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour

---

#### Gap 8: Story 1.2 Page Extraction Blocker (LOW - IN PROGRESS)

**Issue:** Week 0 workaround needs proper Docling page attribution

**Impact:** Blocks NFR7 validation (95%+ source attribution accuracy)

**Status:** IN PROGRESS (Story 1.2 current work)

**Recommendation:** Continue Story 1.2 implementation:
1. Run `scripts/test_page_extraction.py` diagnostic
2. IF Docling returns pages → Fix chunking to preserve metadata
3. IF Docling lacks pages → Implement hybrid (Docling + PyMuPDF)

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours (already in progress)
