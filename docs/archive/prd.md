# RAGLite Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable instant, natural language access to comprehensive financial knowledge from company documents
- Reduce time-to-insight for financial queries from hours/days to minutes (80% reduction)
- Validate complete RAGLite vision: retrieval → analysis → forecasting in single MVP
- Establish production-ready foundation for AI-powered financial intelligence platform
- Prove measurable ROI through time savings and improved decision quality to justify team rollout

### Background Context

Finance teams currently spend 40-60% of their time manually searching through PDFs and Excel spreadsheets to answer stakeholder questions about financial performance. This manual workflow creates decision latency (days to weeks for complex questions), limits strategic agility, and prevents proactive insight discovery. Traditional BI dashboards require predefined queries, while generic LLM tools lack persistent financial knowledge bases and domain optimization.

RAGLite addresses this gap by combining RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture with AI-powered intelligence capabilities. The system ingests financial documents into a vector database, exposes knowledge via MCP (Model Context Protocol), and layers on agentic workflows, forecasting, and proactive insight generation. The MVP validates the complete vision end-to-end: from accurate retrieval through advanced forecasting, accepting higher complexity to prove the full value proposition in a single delivery.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

**Conversational-First Financial Intelligence Interface**

RAGLite delivers financial intelligence through natural language conversation via MCP-compatible clients (Claude Desktop initially). The UX prioritizes:
- **Instant comprehension** - Users ask questions in plain language without learning query syntax
- **Trust through transparency** - Every answer includes verifiable source attribution
- **Progressive disclosure** - Simple queries get simple answers; complex analysis revealed through follow-up
- **Proactive guidance** - System surfaces insights users should know, not just what they ask

**Assumption:** MCP client provides the UI; RAGLite provides the intelligence layer and structured responses optimized for conversational display.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**1. Natural Language Query-Response**
- Users ask financial questions conversationally ("What drove the Q3 revenue variance?")
- System responds with synthesized answer + source citations
- No forms, buttons, or structured UI - pure conversational flow

**2. Source-Attributed Transparency**
- Every factual claim includes document reference (name, page, section)
- Format: "[Answer] (Source: Q3_Financial_Report.pdf, page 12, Revenue Analysis section)"
- Users can verify claims by checking source documents

**3. Multi-Turn Analytical Conversations**
- System maintains context across questions
- Users drill down: "What about marketing specifically?" follows "What drove Q3 variance?"
- Agentic workflows handle multi-step reasoning invisibly

**4. Proactive Insight Surfacing**
- System volunteers strategic insights: "I noticed 3 anomalies in Q3 expenses worth reviewing..."
- Users can accept insight or dismiss
- Insights ranked by priority/impact

### Core Screens and Views

**Note:** Since RAGLite has no custom UI, "screens" here refer to conversational interaction patterns and response formats:

**1. Query Interface (MCP Client Native)**
- User types natural language question in Claude Desktop or compatible MCP client
- No RAGLite-specific UI needed

**2. Answer Display Format (Text Response)**
- Synthesized answer (2-3 paragraphs max)
- Bulleted key findings for complex questions
- Source attribution footer
- Confidence indicator for forecasts/insights

**3. Multi-Document Synthesis View (Structured Text)**
- Comparative tables when synthesizing across documents
- Clear delineation: "Q2 vs Q3" or "Company A vs Company B"
- Source per data point

**4. Forecast/Insight Display (Structured Response)**
- Visual text representation of trends ("Revenue trending up 12% MoM")
- Confidence interval clearly stated ("±10% accuracy")
- Supporting data points and rationale

**5. Error/Clarification Prompts**
- Clear "I cannot answer because..." messages
- Suggested alternative questions or missing context
- Guidance on refining unclear queries

### Accessibility

**Level: N/A - No Custom UI**
- Accessibility responsibility lies with MCP client (Claude Desktop, etc.)
- RAGLite ensures text responses are screen-reader friendly (structured, clear, no visual-only formatting)
- Alt-text approach: All responses are text-native; no images or charts in MVP

### Branding

**Minimal Technical Branding**
- System identifies as "RAGLite Financial Intelligence"
- Responses maintain professional, analytical tone (no playful language)
- No visual branding needed - purely functional conversational interface
- Future consideration: Custom web UI could incorporate company branding (post-MVP)

### Target Device and Platforms

**Primary: Desktop (MCP Client)**
- Claude Desktop on macOS (development/MVP)
- Any MCP-compatible client (desktop-focused)

**Future: Web Responsive (Post-MVP)**
- Custom web UI for team access (Phase 2+)
- Responsive design for tablet/mobile if custom UI built

**MVP Constraint:** No mobile-specific design - desktop MCP client sufficient for single-user validation

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

**Decision deferred to Research Spike** - The Project Brief explicitly states: "Repository Structure: Decision deferred - Monorepo vs. multi-repo, service boundaries, and project structure will be determined after completing technical requirements analysis and deep research spike."

**Architect to determine:** Final repository structure based on research spike findings regarding service complexity, deployment model, and development workflow preferences.

### Service Architecture

**Decision deferred to Research Spike** - The Project Brief states: "MVP: Approach to be determined in research spike (monolithic vs. modular vs. microservices). Future consideration: Architecture decisions deferred until technical requirements are fully understood."

**Critical considerations for Architect:**
- **MVP Development Environment:** Local Docker environment (macOS)
- **MVP Production:** Self-hosted (local server or single cloud instance)
- **Future State:** Cloud infrastructure (AWS or equivalent) for team access
- **Constraint:** Architecture must support migration from local Docker to cloud without major refactoring (NFR16)

**Architect to determine:** Service architecture (monolithic/modular/microservices) based on validated component complexity and deployment requirements from research spike.

### Testing Requirements

**CRITICAL DECISION - Full Testing Pyramid Required:**

Given the ambitious MVP scope with multiple complex, unproven technologies (knowledge graphs, agentic workflows, forecasting), comprehensive testing is essential:

**Unit Testing:**
- Python unit tests for all core components (ingestion, chunking, retrieval, entity extraction)
- Mocking for external dependencies (LLM APIs, vector DB, graph DB)
- Target: 80%+ code coverage for critical paths

**Integration Testing:**
- End-to-end pipeline tests (PDF → ingestion → vector DB → retrieval)
- MCP protocol compliance validation
- Agentic workflow execution validation
- Knowledge graph integration tests (if implemented)

**Accuracy/Quality Testing:**
- Ground truth query set (50+ financial questions with known answers) - **Created in Week 1, not Week 4**
- **Daily accuracy tracking:** Run 10-15 test queries daily during Phase 1 to catch regressions early
- Retrieval accuracy benchmarking (target: 90%+)
- Source attribution validation (target: 95%+)
- Forecast accuracy tracking against actuals
- Hallucination rate monitoring (target: <5%)
- **Decision gate triggers:** If accuracy <70% mid-phase, halt and debug before proceeding

**Manual Testing:**
- Real-world query validation by primary user (you)
- Complex workflow testing (multi-step analysis)
- Edge case exploration (malformed PDFs, ambiguous queries)

**Performance Testing:**
- Query response time benchmarking (p50, p95, p99)
- Document ingestion performance validation
- Concurrent query handling (for cloud deployment)

**Rationale:** High-risk MVP with accuracy requirements (90%+ retrieval, 95%+ source attribution) demands rigorous testing. Manual testing convenience methods essential for solo developer validation.

### Risk-Aware Development Approach

**Based on QA Risk Assessment (docs/qa/project-risk-assessment.md), the following risk mitigations are mandatory:**

**Week 0 Integration Spike (3-5 days before Phase 1):**
- Validate Docling + Fin-E5 + Qdrant + FastMCP integration on real financial PDFs
- Establish baseline accuracy ≥70% on 15 test queries
- **GO/NO-GO Decision:** If <70% accuracy, reconsider technology stack before proceeding

**5-Week Phase 1 Timeline (Extended from 4):**
- Original 4-week estimate + 20% buffer for learning curve and integration debugging
- Solo developer + AI model requires realistic timeline expectations

**Daily Accuracy Tracking (Weeks 1-5):**
- Run 10-15 test queries daily, track trend line
- **Early warning trigger:** If accuracy drops <70% mid-phase, HALT feature work and debug

**Weekly Decision Gates:**
- Week 1: Ingestion quality validated
- Week 2: Retrieval baseline ≥70%
- Week 3: Synthesis quality acceptable
- Week 5: Final validation ≥90% or extend for fixes

**Descope Authority (If Timelines Slip):**
- Drop Contextual Retrieval → simple chunking
- Drop Excel support → PDFs only
- Drop GraphRAG → vector-only MVP
- Drop Forecasting → defer to Phase 3+

**Code Quality Practices (Solo Dev + AI):**
- Daily self-review ritual
- Test before commit (50%+ coverage on critical paths)
- AI-generated code validation before commit
- Knowledge capture in docs/dev-notes.md

See Story 0.1 (Week 0 Spike) and Story 1.12 (Daily Tracking) for detailed implementation.

## Epic 1: Foundation & Accurate Retrieval

**Epic Goal:** Deliver a working conversational financial Q&A system with 90%+ retrieval accuracy that enables users to ask natural language questions via MCP and receive accurate, source-attributed answers from company financial documents.

**⚠️ RISK MITIGATION: Epic 1 includes Week 0 Integration Spike (Story 0.1) to validate technology stack before committing to 5-week Phase 1 development. See Story 0.1 for mandatory go/no-go criteria.**

### Story 0.1: Week 0 Integration Spike (MANDATORY PRE-PHASE 1)

**As a** developer,
**I want** to validate end-to-end technology integration on real financial documents BEFORE starting Phase 1,
**so that** I can identify showstopper issues early and establish accuracy baseline.

**Duration:** 3-5 days
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Blocks all Phase 1 work

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Ingest 1 real company financial PDF (100+ pages) with Docling
2. Generate embeddings with Fin-E5 model
3. Store vectors in Qdrant via Docker Compose
4. Implement basic MCP server (FastMCP) exposing query tool
5. Create 15 ground truth Q&A pairs from test document
6. Measure baseline retrieval accuracy (vector search only, no LLM synthesis)
7. Document integration issues, API quirks, version conflicts discovered
8. Establish performance baseline (ingestion time, query latency)

**Success Criteria (GO/NO-GO for Phase 1):**
- ✅ **GO:** Baseline retrieval accuracy ≥70% (10+ out of 15 queries return relevant chunks)
- ✅ **GO:** End-to-end pipeline functional (PDF → Docling → Fin-E5 → Qdrant → FastMCP)
- ✅ **GO:** No major integration blockers requiring >2 days to resolve
- ⚠️ **REASSESS:** Accuracy 50-69% → Investigate root cause, may need chunking/embedding adjustments
- 🛑 **NO-GO:** Accuracy <50% → Technology stack unsuitable, consider alternatives (AWS Textract, different embeddings)

**Deliverables:**
- Working integration spike codebase (throwaway prototype, not production)
- Week 0 Spike Report documenting: accuracy baseline, integration issues, recommendations
- Updated Phase 1 plan based on learnings

**Rationale:** Risk assessment (RISK-001, RISK-002) identifies high probability of integration failures and accuracy shortfalls. Week 0 validation de-risks Phase 1 by surfacing issues early when pivoting is cheap.

### Story 0.2: API Account & Cloud Infrastructure Setup (MANDATORY PRE-PHASE 1)

**As a** user,
**I want** all required third-party API accounts and cloud infrastructure configured BEFORE development begins,
**so that** development is not blocked by account provisioning delays or missing credentials.

**Duration:** 1-2 days (account approval may cause delays)
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Blocks all Phase 1 work
**Assignment:** USER (human-only task - requires payment information, company email verification, terms acceptance)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **Anthropic Claude API Account:**
   - Account created at console.anthropic.com
   - API key generated and securely stored
   - Usage limits reviewed (ensure sufficient for MVP development: ~1M tokens estimated)
   - Billing configured (credit card or payment method on file)
   - API key added to `.env.example` template as placeholder: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here`

2. **AWS Account (Conditional - if using Bedrock or cloud deployment):**
   - AWS account created or existing account identified
   - IAM user created with appropriate permissions (Bedrock access if using, ECS/S3 if deploying)
   - Access keys generated (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key)
   - AWS credentials stored securely (not in repository)
   - AWS CLI configured locally for development/deployment

3. **Qdrant Cloud Account (for Production Deployment - Epic 5):**
   - Qdrant Cloud account created at cloud.qdrant.io
   - Free tier or paid plan selected based on MVP requirements
   - API key generated for cloud instance access
   - Note: Local Qdrant via Docker Compose for MVP development (Epic 1-4)

4. **Secrets Management Setup:**
   - `.env.example` template created with all required API key placeholders
   - `.env` added to `.gitignore` (prevent credential leakage)
   - Documentation includes instructions for developers to create local `.env` from template
   - For cloud deployment: AWS Secrets Manager or equivalent identified for production

5. **Cost Monitoring Setup:**
   - Anthropic Claude API usage alerts configured (notify at 50%, 75%, 90% of budget)
   - AWS billing alerts configured if using AWS services
   - Budget defined: Estimated $200-500 for MVP development phase (verify sufficiency)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All API keys generated and accessible (verified by test API call)
- ✅ No credential exposure in version control (`.env` gitignored, `.env.example` has placeholders only)
- ✅ Documentation complete for other developers to replicate setup
- ✅ Billing/budget alerts active to prevent surprise costs

**Deliverables:**
- `.env.example` file with all API key placeholders documented
- `docs/api-setup-guide.md` documenting account creation steps and credential management
- Active API accounts with valid credentials ready for Story 1.1

**Rationale:** External API accounts often have 24-48 hour approval delays (especially AWS). Creating accounts BEFORE development ensures no blocking delays during Phase 1. This is a human-only task requiring payment methods and email verification that cannot be automated.

**Dependencies:** None (can run in parallel with Story 0.1 Week 0 Spike)

### Story 1.1: Project Setup & Development Environment

**As a** developer,
**I want** a configured development environment with all necessary tools and dependencies,

5. Ingestion errors logged with clear error messages for malformed or corrupted PDFs
6. Successfully ingests sample company financial PDFs provided for testing
7. Ingestion performance meets <5 minutes for 100-page financial report (NFR2)
8. Unit tests cover ingestion pipeline with mocked Docling responses
9. Integration test validates end-to-end PDF ingestion with real sample document

### Story 1.3: Excel Document Ingestion

**As a** system,
**I want** to ingest Excel spreadsheets and extract tabular financial data,
**so that** financial data from Excel files is available alongside PDF content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Excel parsing library integrated (openpyxl, pandas, or Architect-specified tool)
2. Excel ingestion pipeline accepts file path and extracts sheet data preserving formulas and relationships
3. Multi-sheet workbooks handled with sheet names preserved as metadata
4. Numeric formatting preserved (currencies, percentages, dates)
5. Successfully ingests sample company Excel financial files
6. Errors handled gracefully for password-protected or corrupted files
7. Unit tests cover Excel parsing logic
8. Integration test validates end-to-end Excel ingestion

### Story 1.4: Document Chunking & Semantic Segmentation

**As a** system,
**I want** to chunk ingested documents using semantic segmentation optimized for financial context,
**so that** retrieval returns relevant, complete information without context fragmentation.

### Story 1.5: Embedding Model Integration & Vector Generation

**As a** system,
**I want** to generate vector embeddings for document chunks using the Architect-selected embedding model,
**so that** semantic similarity search is possible for retrieval.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Embedding model integrated per Architect's selection from research spike
2. Vector embeddings generated for all document chunks
3. Embedding generation handles batch processing for efficiency

| 7. Technical Guidance            | PASS    | None - Appropriately defers decisions to Architect while providing clear constraints                |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Minor: Data retention policies "TBD", schema evolution not explicitly addressed in stories          |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS    | None - Clear language, consistent terminology, good structure                                        |

### Recommendations

**For Architect Phase:**

1. **Execute FR33 Research Spike First** - Critical path: No implementation until research spike validates all technical approaches

2. **Make Go/No-Go Decisions on Advanced Features:**
   - Knowledge Graph: Demonstrate value vs. complexity before Epic 2
   - Agentic Framework: Select approach with complexity/capability trade-off explicit
   - Forecasting: Validate accuracy achievable before Epic 4

3. **Define Architecture with Descope Flexibility:**
   - Design for Epic 1-2 "Minimum Viable RAG" fallback if Epics 3-5 prove too complex
   - Ensure architecture supports graceful degradation per NFR32

4. **Clarify Data Retention & Schema Evolution:**
   - Define retention policies or confirm defaults acceptable
   - Include schema versioning strategy (even if simple for greenfield MVP)

### Final Decision

✅ **READY FOR ARCHITECT**

The PRD and epic structure are comprehensive, properly scoped, and ready for architectural design. The document demonstrates clear problem definition, appropriate MVP scope with validation checkpoints, comprehensive requirements, well-structured epics, and technical guidance that appropriately defers decisions to Architect while providing clear constraints.

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

**Status:** Not required for RAGLite MVP.

**Rationale:** RAGLite delivers intelligence through MCP-compatible clients (Claude Desktop) with no custom UI. UX is defined by conversational interaction patterns and response formats documented in the UI Design Goals section. The MCP client handles all visual presentation.

**If custom web UI is pursued post-MVP:** Re-engage UX Expert to design conversational interface, dashboard visualizations, and team collaboration features.

### Architect Prompt

**Prompt for Architect:**

I need you to create the complete architecture for **RAGLite** - an AI-powered financial intelligence platform. The PRD is ready at `docs/prd.md` and the Project Brief is at `docs/brief.md`.

**Critical First Step - Research Spike (FR33):**

Before designing the architecture, you MUST execute a 1-2 week research spike to validate all critical technical decisions:

1. **Docling PDF Extraction & Embedding Model Selection**
   - Test Docling on sample company financial PDFs
   - Validate table extraction accuracy (target: 95%+)
   - Benchmark and select embedding model during Docling evaluation
   - Decide: Is Docling sufficient, or do we need AWS Textract fallback?

2. **Knowledge Graph Necessity Assessment**
   - Benchmark RAG-only vs. Hybrid RAG+KG on sample queries
   - Evaluate entity extraction quality from financial documents
   - Decide: Implement KG in MVP, defer to Phase 2, or skip entirely?

3. **Agentic Framework Selection**
   - Define required workflow complexity
   - Prototype simple multi-step workflow in: LangGraph, AWS Bedrock Agents, Claude function calling
   - Decide: Which framework (if any) balances complexity vs. capability?

4. **Forecasting Implementation Strategy**
   - Inventory KPIs to forecast and data availability
   - Benchmark LLM-based vs. statistical forecasting accuracy
   - Decide: LLM-based, statistical, hybrid, or simple trend projection?

5. **Architecture & Repository Structure**
   - Based on findings from 1-4, design system architecture
   - Decide: Monorepo vs. multi-repo, service boundaries, component interactions
   - Create skeleton project structure

**Research Spike Deliverable:** Architecture decision document with go/no-go recommendations for each major component, selected technologies, and updated MVP scope based on validated feasibility.

**Architecture Requirements:**

- **Deployment:** Local Docker MVP → Cloud production (AWS or equivalent) migration path
- **Performance:** <5 sec queries (p50), <30 sec complex workflows, 90% retrieval accuracy, 95% source attribution
- **Security:** Financial data on controlled infrastructure, encryption at rest (production), secrets management, audit logging
- **Scalability:** 100+ documents, 50+ queries/day (MVP) → 10+ concurrent users (production)
- **Stack:** Python throughout, Qdrant vector DB, MCP protocol compliance
- **Testing:** Full pyramid (unit, integration, accuracy, manual, performance)

**Design for Graceful Degradation (NFR32):** System must operate with vector-only retrieval if KG fails, basic Q&A if agentic workflows fail, and without forecasting if models prove inaccurate.

**Epic Structure for Implementation:**
1. Foundation & Accurate Retrieval (3-4 weeks)
2. Advanced Document Understanding (2-3 weeks, KG conditional on research spike)
3. AI Intelligence & Orchestration (2-3 weeks)
4. Forecasting & Proactive Insights (2-3 weeks)
5. Production Readiness (2-3 weeks)

**Timeline:** 10-12 weeks total (research spike + implementation)

**Output Required:** Complete architecture document including system design, data flow diagrams, technology stack, deployment architecture, schema design (if applicable), API specifications, and implementation guidance for dev team.
