# Epic 2: Advanced Document Understanding

**Epic Goal:** Handle complex financial documents and multi-document synthesis with advanced table extraction and knowledge graph integration (if Architect approved), enabling queries that require relational reasoning and synthesis across multiple sources.

## Story 2.1: Advanced Table Extraction & Understanding

**As a** system,
**I want** to deeply parse and understand complex financial tables with multi-level headers and merged cells,
**so that** tabular financial data is accurately retrievable and queryable.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Enhanced Docling configuration per Architect's specification for table-aware chunking
2. Multi-level table headers correctly identified and preserved in structure
3. Merged cells handled without data loss or misalignment
4. Table structure metadata captured (column headers, row labels, table title/caption)
5. Table extraction accuracy 95%+ validated on complex financial tables (NFR9)
6. Structured data extraction enables query answering from table contents
7. Integration test validates accurate extraction from sample financial tables
8. Manual validation on real company financial reports with complex tables

## Story 2.2: Multi-Document Query Synthesis

**As a** user,
**I want** to ask queries requiring synthesis across multiple financial documents,
**so that** I can compare performance across time periods or entities without manual document navigation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Retrieval logic identifies relevant chunks from multiple source documents
2. Answer synthesis explicitly compares/contrasts information from different sources
3. Citations clearly differentiate sources: "Q2 revenue was $5M (Q2_Report.pdf, p.3); Q3 revenue was $6M (Q3_Report.pdf, p.3)"
4. Queries like "Compare Q2 vs Q3 marketing spend" answered accurately
5. Successfully handles 3+ document synthesis queries
6. Test set includes 10+ multi-document queries with validation
7. Response clarity validated: user can understand which data came from which document

## Story 2.3: Entity Extraction from Financial Documents *(IF KG APPROVED BY ARCHITECT)*

**As a** system,
**I want** to extract financial entities (companies, departments, metrics, KPIs, time periods) from documents,
**so that** knowledge graph can be constructed for relational reasoning.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Entity extraction pipeline implemented per Architect's approach (LLM-based or NER)
2. Financial entity types recognized: Companies, Departments, Metrics/KPIs, Time Periods, Dollar Amounts
3. Entity extraction accuracy validated on sample documents (Architect-defined threshold)
4. Entities stored with normalization (e.g., "Q3 2024" and "Third Quarter 2024" map to same entity)
5. Entity metadata includes source document and context for verification
6. Unit tests cover entity extraction logic
7. Integration test validates entities extracted from sample financial PDFs

## Story 2.4: Knowledge Graph Construction *(IF KG APPROVED BY ARCHITECT)*

**As a** system,
**I want** to construct knowledge graph capturing relationships between financial entities,
**so that** relational queries ("How does marketing spend correlate with revenue?") can be answered via graph traversal.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Graph database deployed (Neo4j or Architect-selected alternative) via Docker Compose
2. Entity nodes created for extracted financial entities
3. Relationship edges created capturing: correlations, hierarchies (dept→company), temporal sequences (Q2→Q3)
4. Graph schema designed per Architect's specification
5. Graph populated from sample financial documents with entities and relationships
6. Graph querying interface functional (Cypher or equivalent per database choice)
7. Integration test validates graph construction from sample document set

## Story 2.5: Hybrid RAG + Knowledge Graph Retrieval *(IF KG APPROVED BY ARCHITECT)*

**As a** system,
**I want** to combine vector similarity search with knowledge graph traversal for retrieval,
**so that** relational queries leverage graph structure while maintaining semantic retrieval capability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Hybrid retrieval orchestration logic determines when to use vector-only vs. vector + graph
2. Entity-based queries trigger graph traversal to find related entities
3. Graph results combined with vector results for comprehensive answer synthesis
4. Relational queries ("correlation between X and Y") answered using graph relationships
5. Performance acceptable: <15 seconds for complex hybrid queries (NFR13)
6. Test set includes 10+ relational queries validated for accuracy
7. Comparison benchmark: hybrid retrieval improves accuracy vs. vector-only for relational queries

## Story 2.6: Context Preservation Across Chunks

**As a** system,
**I want** to preserve financial context when retrieving and synthesizing information,
**so that** answers include necessary context (time periods, entities, comparisons) without ambiguity.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Chunk metadata enriched with contextual information (fiscal period, company, department)
2. Answer synthesis includes contextual qualifiers ("In Q3 2024, Company A's revenue...")
3. Ambiguous queries prompt for clarification ("Which quarter did you mean?")
4. Test queries validate context correctness (no mixing of time periods or entities)
5. Manual validation confirms context clarity in responses

## Story 2.7: Enhanced Test Set for Advanced Features

**As a** developer,
**I want** to validate advanced document understanding with expanded test queries,
**so that** table extraction, multi-document synthesis, and KG (if present) are objectively measured.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Test set expanded with 20+ queries testing advanced features (tables, multi-doc, relational)
2. Table-based queries validated (e.g., "What was Line Item X in the Q3 expense table?")
3. Multi-document synthesis queries validated
4. Relational queries validated (if KG implemented)
5. Accuracy measured and documented for advanced query types
6. Regression testing ensures Epic 1 accuracy maintained
