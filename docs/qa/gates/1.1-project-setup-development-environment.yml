  notes: |
    Shared module foundation is comprehensive with 14/14 tests passing (~90% coverage).
    Critical infrastructure validation missing (10 P0 tests not implemented).
    Developer onboarding workflow not validated (E2E tests missing).
    Recommendation: Proceed to Story 1.2 with conditions - implement infrastructure tests during 1.2 development.
