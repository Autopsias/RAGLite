# Story 1.14: Ground Truth Validation Corrections Report

**Generated:** 2025-10-14
**Validator:** Dev Agent (Amelia)
**Status:** CRITICAL DATA QUALITY ISSUE IDENTIFIED

---

## Executive Summary

Validation of all 50 ground truth questions against the actual PDF content reveals **severe data quality issues**:

- **Total Valid:** 16/50 (32%)
- **Corrections Needed:** 34/50 (68%)
- **NOT FOUND:** 20+ questions (keywords not found in ¬±10 page window)

This explains the 18% retrieval accuracy observed in Story 1.13. The ground truth questions were created with estimated page numbers and were never manually validated against the PDF (Story 1.12A AC6 was skipped).

## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Mass "NOT FOUND" (20+ questions)

**Problem:** Keywords for these questions don't appear in the ¬±10 page window around expected pages.

**Possible Causes:**
1. Questions reference content that doesn't exist in the PDF
2. Keywords are too specific or incorrectly phrased
3. Content is in a completely different section of the PDF
4. Questions were generated without PDF reference

**Affected Questions:** Q12, Q13, Q19, Q20, Q25, Q27, Q28, Q30, Q34, Q36, Q37, Q38, Q42, Q43, Q46, Q47, Q48, Q49, Q50

**Recommendation:**
- Expand search to entire PDF (pages 1-160)
- If still not found, mark questions as INVALID and rewrite based on actual PDF content
- Alternative: Remove these questions and replace with validated questions

---

### Issue 2: Generic Number Matches

**Problem:** Some questions match numbers (8, 12, 70, 30, etc.) that appear across many pages but lack context.

**Examples:**
- Q39: "8" and "12" appear on 16+ pages
- Q40: "5.7", "5.1", "3.9" appear on multiple pages
- Q41: "ratio 70/30" appears across Angola and Tunisia sections

**Recommendation:**
- Refine keywords to include contextual terms (e.g., "employee turnover" not just "8", "12")
- Verify the question actually asks about content present in the PDF
- Consider rewriting questions for specificity

---

### Issue 3: Multi-Country Document Structure

**Observation:** The PDF contains sections for Portugal, Angola, Tunisia, etc. Many keywords appear in multiple country sections.

**Impact:** Questions need to specify WHICH country/section they're asking about, otherwise they're ambiguous.

**Recommendation:**
- Update expected_section to include country (e.g., "Portugal Cement - Cost Analysis")
- Refine questions to be country-specific
- Update keywords to include country identifiers

---

## Proposed Correction Strategy

### Phase 1: Apply Confirmed Corrections (13 questions)
**Target: 30 minutes**

Questions with clear page corrections:
- Cost Analysis: Q1‚Üí46, Q2‚Üí46, Q6‚Üí46, Q9‚Üí48, Q11‚Üí46
- Financial Performance: Q22‚Üí73, Q23‚Üí69, Q24‚Üí77, Q29‚Üí82
- Safety: Q31‚Üí87
- Operating Expenses: Q45‚Üí111

### Phase 2: Expand Search for NOT FOUND (20 questions)
**Target: 1 hour**

- Search entire PDF (pages 1-160) for each NOT FOUND question
- Document: (a) page found, (b) keywords need refinement, or (c) content doesn't exist
- For (c): Mark question as INVALID, propose rewrite or removal

### Phase 3: Refine Ambiguous Questions (11 questions)
**Target: 30 minutes**

- Questions with generic number matches need keyword refinement
- Add contextual keywords
- Test refined keywords against PDF

### Phase 4: Re-validate All Corrections
**Target: 30 minutes**

- Apply all corrections to ground_truth.py
- Run structural validation
- Run accuracy tests
- Verify ‚â•90% accuracy achieved

---

## Rollback Decision Point

**If accuracy still <80% after corrections:**

This indicates the ground truth questions are fundamentally misaligned with the PDF content. Options:

1. **Create entirely new ground truth** (6-8 hours)
   - Open PDF, read through sections
   - Write 50 NEW questions based on actual content
   - Validate as we write

2. **Reduce scope to validated subset** (30 questions)
   - Use only the 16 validated questions + 14 corrected questions
   - Document risk of smaller test set

3. **Use different PDF**
   - Locate the correct PDF from Week 0 spike
   - Validate questions against correct PDF

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions:**

1. ‚úÖ Complete validation of all 50 questions (DONE)
2. üîÑ Apply Phase 1 corrections (13 clear updates)
3. üîÑ Expand search for NOT FOUND questions
4. üîÑ Apply all corrections to ground_truth.py
5. üîÑ Run accuracy tests
6. üîÑ Update documentation

**Decision Point:** After Phase 2, if >15 questions are still INVALID, escalate to Ricardo for guidance on whether to:
- Rewrite invalid questions
- Replace with new questions based on PDF content
- Reduce test set scope
