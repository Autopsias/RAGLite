# NFR Assessment: Story 0.1 - Week 0 Integration Spike

**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect)
**Story Type:** Integration Spike (Throwaway Prototype)
**Quality Score:** 80/100

---

## Summary

| NFR Category | Status | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| **Security** | ✅ PASS | Environment variables used, no hardcoded secrets (NFR13 compliant) |
| **Performance** | ✅ PASS | Ingestion <5 min (NFR2), Query <1s (exceeds NFR5) |
| **Reliability** | ⚠️ CONCERNS | Minimal error handling (15 try/except blocks), no retry/circuit breakers |
| **Maintainability** | ⚠️ CONCERNS | Test coverage 64% (below 80% target), spike code not production-ready |

**Overall Assessment:** **PASS with minor concerns**
Spike successfully validates technology stack with acceptable quality for throwaway prototype. Performance exceeds targets, security basics implemented, but reliability and maintainability are minimal (expected for spike).

---

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Security: ✅ PASS

**NFRs Evaluated:**

- ✅ **NFR13:** API keys and secrets via environment variables (no hardcoded credentials)

**Evidence:**

- `spike/config.py` uses `os.getenv()` with defaults for all configuration:

  ```python
  QDRANT_URL = os.getenv("QDRANT_URL", "http://localhost:6333")
  EMBEDDING_MODEL = os.getenv("EMBEDDING_MODEL", "intfloat/e5-large-v2")
  ```

- No hardcoded credentials found in codebase (grep search: 0 matches)
- `.env` file pattern used (`.env.example` exists)

**Not Applicable for Spike:**

- NFR11: Controlled infrastructure (local dev only)
- NFR12: Encryption at rest (dev environment)
- NFR14: Audit logging (not required for spike)
- NFR15: Data retention policies (not required for spike)

**Status Rationale:** Spike implements basic secret management aligned with NFR13. No security vulnerabilities introduced. **PASS**

---

### 2. Performance: ✅ PASS

**NFRs Evaluated:**

- ✅ **NFR2:** Process <100 pages in <5 minutes
- ✅ **Query Performance:** <10 seconds (Story AC requirement, related to NFR5)

**Evidence:**

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| PDF Ingestion (100 pages) | <5 min | ~4.28 min (projected from 160-page test) | ✅ PASS |
| Chunking (260 chunks) | - | Negligible (included in ingestion) | ✅ |
| Embedding Generation (260 chunks) | - | 20.13s (12.91 chunks/sec) | ✅ |
| Qdrant Storage (260 vectors) | - | 0.27s (963 vectors/sec) | ✅ |
| Query Latency (p50) | <10s | ~0.83s avg | ✅ PASS (12x better) |

**Performance Breakdown:**

- **Ingestion:** 413.06s for 160 pages = 2.58s/page
  - Projected 100 pages: 258s = 4.28 min ✅
  - **Meets NFR2 with 14% margin**
- **Query:** 0.83s average (embedding 77ms + search 150ms + formatting 10ms)
  - **Exceeds target by 12x (well under 10s)**

**Not Tested:**

- NFR3: 100+ document knowledge base (only 1 PDF tested)
- NFR4: 50+ queries/day throughput (not measured)
- NFR5: Complex agentic workflows <30s (N/A for spike, no workflows)

**Status Rationale:** Core performance requirements (NFR2, query latency) **EXCEED** targets. **PASS**

---

### 3. Reliability: ⚠️ CONCERNS

**NFRs Evaluated:**

- ⚠️ **NFR20:** Clear error messages when queries fail (not validated)
- ⚠️ **Error Handling:** Minimal implementation

**Evidence:**

- **Error handling present:** 15 try/except blocks across 4 files
  - `spike/mcp_server.py`: 4 occurrences
  - `spike/ingest_pdf.py`: 4 occurrences
  - `spike/chunk_documents.py`: 1 occurrence
  - `spike/test_mcp_server.py`: 6 occurrences
- **No retry logic** for transient failures
- **No circuit breakers** for Qdrant or model failures
- **No graceful degradation** beyond basic exception catching

**Missing:**

- Health check beyond basic Qdrant connectivity (no model health validation)
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Structured error logging (uses print statements)
- Validation of error message clarity (NFR20)

**Status Rationale:** Minimal error handling appropriate for spike, but insufficient for production. No critical reliability issues observed during testing. **CONCERNS** (acceptable for throwaway code, must improve for Phase 1)

---

### 4. Maintainability: ⚠️ CONCERNS

**NFRs Evaluated:**

- ⚠️ **Test Coverage:** 64% (below 80% target)
- ⚠️ **Code Structure:** Spike quality (throwaway, not production)

**Evidence:**

**Test Coverage Analysis (from Trace Matrix):**

- Total requirements: 11 (8 ACs + 3 NFRs)
- Full test coverage: 7/11 (64%)
- Partial coverage: 4/11 (36%)
- **Below 80% target by 16 percentage points**

**Code Structure:**

- ✅ Type hints present in MCP server (Pydantic models)
- ✅ Docstrings present in key functions
- ✅ Configuration externalized (config.py)
- ❌ No unit tests (only integration/execution validation)
- ❌ Code duplication between scripts (no shared utilities)
- ❌ Limited modularity (monolithic scripts)

**Documentation:**

- ✅ Week 0 Spike Report complete
- ✅ Integration issues documented (8 issues catalogued)
- ✅ Ground truth test set documented
- ❌ No API documentation (acceptable for spike)

**Status Rationale:** Test coverage below target but acceptable for spike. Code structure is intentionally simple (throwaway prototype). Documentation exists but production quality not expected. **CONCERNS** (must improve for Phase 1 production code)

---

## Quality Score Breakdown

**Calculation Method:**

```
Base Score: 100
- 0 for PASS (Security, Performance)
- 10 for CONCERNS (Reliability)
- 10 for CONCERNS (Maintainability)
= 80/100
```

**Interpretation:**

- **80-100:** Excellent (production-ready)
- **60-79:** Good (acceptable with improvements)
- **40-59:** Fair (needs work before production)
- **<40:** Poor (significant quality issues)

**Result:** 80/100 = **Excellent for spike**, Good baseline for Phase 1

---

## Critical Issues

### None Identified ✅

All issues are **acceptable for spike scope**:

1. Minimal error handling → Expected for throwaway prototype
2. Test coverage 64% → Adequate for technology validation
3. No retry/circuit breakers → Not required for single-user spike
4. Code structure not production-ready → Intentional (to be rewritten in Phase 1)
