## Recommendations


### Immediate Actions Required
1. HALT Phase 3 planning until issues resolved
2. Conduct root cause analysis (investigation checklist below)
3. Review ground truth test set quality
4. Consider Phase 2 (GraphRAG + Neo4j) implementation
5. Evaluate alternative technology stack options

### Investigation Checklist
- [ ] Verify Docling extraction quality (page numbers correct?)
- [ ] Review chunking boundaries (overlap, size, semantic quality)
- [ ] Test embedding quality (Fin-E5 model performance)
- [ ] Check Qdrant search parameters (top_k, HNSW config)
- [ ] Validate ground truth test set (are questions answerable?)
- [ ] Review recent code changes for regressions
- [ ] Test with alternative embedding models (if needed)
- [ ] Consider multi-hop query support (GraphRAG Phase 2)

### Escalation
This decision requires stakeholder review and approval before proceeding.
