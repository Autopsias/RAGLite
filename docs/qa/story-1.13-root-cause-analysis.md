# Story 1.13 Root Cause Analysis
## Fix Page Number Attribution Bug

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Story:** Story 1.13 - Fix Page Number Attribution Bug
**Status:** ✅ FIX VERIFIED - Ground Truth Mismatch Identified

---

## Executive Summary

**Page number attribution bug has been successfully fixed.** The fix extracts actual page numbers from Docling provenance metadata instead of estimating from character position. However, validation still shows low accuracy (18%) due to **ground truth test set mismatch with actual PDF content**.

**Key Finding:** The ground truth test queries expect data that doesn't exist on the referenced pages in the actual PDF being tested.

---

## Technical Fix Implemented

### 1. Page Number Extraction Fix

**Problem:** Original code estimated page numbers from character position:
```python
# OLD BUG - Estimated pages from character position
page_no = int(char_offset / chars_per_page) + 1
```

**Solution:** Extract actual page numbers from Docling provenance:
```python
# FIXED - Use actual page from provenance
if hasattr(item, 'prov') and item.prov:
    page_no = item.prov[0].page_no  # Actual PDF page number
```

### 2. Empty Chunk Handling

**Problem:** Pages with only images/tables created chunks with 0 words.

**Solution:** Skip pages with no text content:
```python
# Skip pages with no text content (e.g., pages with only images/tables)
if not page_words:
    continue
```

## Verification Results

### Small PDF Test (10 pages) ✅ PASSED

**File:** tests/fixtures/sample_financial_report.pdf

**Results:**
- All 3 test queries returned results
- Keyword accuracy: 87.5%
- Page numbers: Valid (pages 3-4 within 10-page bounds)
- Retrieval working correctly with actual content

**Sample Query:**
```
Query: "What are the health and safety KPIs?"
Result: Page 4, Score 0.835
Content: "Secil - Secil Group - Health & Safety KPI's (1) -  Nº Lost Time Injuries..."
Keywords found: 3/3 (100%)
```

### Full PDF Test (160 pages) ⚠️ GROUND TRUTH MISMATCH

**File:** docs/sample pdf/2025-08 Performance Review CONSO_v2.pdf

**Migration Results:**
- ✅ 147 chunks stored (down from 161 - correctly skipping empty pages)
- ✅ Page range: 1-160 (valid)
- ✅ Duration: 11.8 minutes
- ✅ No errors

**Validation Results:**
- ❌ Retrieval Accuracy: 18% (9/50 queries)
- ❌ Attribution Accuracy: 18% (9/50 queries)

## Root Cause: Ground Truth Mismatch

### Evidence

**Query 1 Expectation (from ground_truth.py):**
- Question: "What are the fixed costs per ton for operations?"
- Expected Page: 45
- Expected Keywords: "fixed costs", "EUR/ton", "26.8", "22.1", "20.5"

**Actual Page 45 Content:**
```
Secil - Portugal - Portugal Cement - Fogos Licenciados Fogos licenciados Portugal Dados INE 2025 2025 Fogos licenciados: Mar 2021 -Abr2025 Mensal LTM
```

**Analysis:** Page 45 contains housing license data (Fogos Licenciados), NOT cost analysis data!

### Systematic Verification

Checked multiple ground truth pages:

| Page | Expected Content | Actual Content |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| 45 | Fixed costs analysis | Housing licenses (Fogos Licenciados) |
| 46 | Cost metrics | Operational Performance - Portugal Cement |
| 47 | Margin data | Margin by Plant |
| 48 | Operating expenses | Plant-specific data (Outão) |
| 50 | Employee costs | Plant-specific data (Pataias) |

**Conclusion:** Ground truth queries reference pages with completely different content than expected.

## Why Small PDF Worked But Large PDF Failed

1. **Small PDF Test (sample_financial_report.pdf):**
   - Contains 10 pages of health & safety KPI data
   - Test queries matched actual content
   - ✅ Retrieval accuracy: 87.5%

2. **Large PDF Test (2025-08 Performance Review CONSO_v2.pdf):**
   - 160 pages of financial performance data
   - Ground truth expects different content/page structure
   - ❌ Retrieval accuracy: 18% (content mismatch, not extraction bug)

---

## Technical Verification

### Page Number Extraction ✅ WORKING

Verified page numbers are correctly extracted from Docling provenance:

```python
# Test code to verify
points, _ = qdrant.scroll(collection_name="financial_docs", limit=200)
page_numbers = [p.payload.get("page_number") for p in points]

print(f"Min page: {min(page_numbers)}")  # 1
print(f"Max page: {max(page_numbers)}")  # 160
print(f"Unique pages: {len(set(page_numbers))}")  # 146
```

**Result:** Pages 1-160, all within valid PDF bounds ✓

### Chunk Content ✅ WORKING

Verified chunks contain actual text (not empty):

```python
for chunk in chunks[:5]:
    word_count = chunk.payload.get("word_count", 0)
    print(f"Chunk words: {word_count}")

# Output:
# Chunk words: 106
# Chunk words: 298
# Chunk words: 415
# ...
```

**Result:** All chunks have meaningful content ✓

## Implications

### Story 1.13 Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The page number attribution bug has been **successfully fixed**:

1. ✅ Page numbers extracted from Docling provenance (not estimated)
2. ✅ Empty pages correctly skipped
3. ✅ Unit tests passing (4/4)
4. ✅ Integration tests passing (2/2)
5. ✅ Small PDF validation passed (87.5% accuracy)
6. ✅ Code changes deployed and tested

### New Issue Identified: Ground Truth Test Set

**Issue:** Ground truth test queries don't match actual PDF content.

**Options:**

**Option A:** Fix ground truth test set
- Update expected page numbers to match actual PDF
- Re-validate expected keywords against actual content
- Effort: 2-4 hours to manually verify 50 queries

**Option B:** Find correct PDF version
- Locate PDF version that matches ground truth expectations
- Re-ingest and test
- Effort: 1-2 hours if PDF exists

**Option C:** Create new ground truth from actual PDF
- Generate 50 new Q&A pairs from actual PDF content
- Document expected pages and keywords
- Effort: 4-6 hours for comprehensive coverage

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Mark Story 1.13 as COMPLETE** ✅
   - Page attribution bug is fixed
   - Fix verified on small PDF test
   - All unit/integration tests passing

2. **Create New Story: "Fix Ground Truth Test Set"**
   - Investigate PDF version mismatch
   - Either fix ground truth or find correct PDF
   - Re-run validation

3. **Update Epic 1 Status**
   - Page attribution fix: DONE
   - Accuracy validation: BLOCKED (ground truth issue)

### Investigation Checklist

- [ ] Check git history for ground truth creation (when was it written?)
- [ ] Compare PDF file sizes/dates (version mismatch?)
- [ ] Ask stakeholder for correct PDF version
- [ ] Review Pages 43-118 manually (ground truth query range)
- [ ] Consider if PDF structure changed (pages added/removed?)
