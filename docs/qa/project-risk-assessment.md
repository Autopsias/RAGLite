# RAGLite Project Risk Assessment

**Assessment Date:** 2025-10-03
**Assessed By:** Quinn (QA Agent)
**Project Phase:** Pre-Development (Architecture Complete, Implementation Not Started)
**Assessment Scope:** Full project lifecycle (Phases 1-4)

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Project Risk Level:** 🟡 **MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Key Finding:** RAGLite is an ambitious MVP with multiple complex, research-validated but unproven-in-practice technologies. The architecture demonstrates excellent risk mitigation through phased complexity and fallback strategies, but execution risk remains high due to:

1. **Solo developer + AI pair programming** model (untested at this complexity level)
2. **Multiple novel technologies** integrated simultaneously (Docling, Fin-E5, Contextual Retrieval, GraphRAG, AWS Strands)
3. **Aggressive accuracy targets** (90%+ retrieval, 95%+ attribution, ±8% forecast accuracy)
4. **4-week Phase 1 timeline** for unproven technology integration

**Recommendation:** **PROCEED WITH CAUTION** - Architecture is sound, but implement comprehensive decision gates and be prepared to descope advanced features (GraphRAG, Forecasting) if Phase 1 validation fails.

## Critical Risks (P0 - Address Before Development Starts)

### RISK-001: Technical Complexity Overload 🔴 CRITICAL

**Category:** Technical Complexity
**Probability:** HIGH (70%)
**Impact:** HIGH (Project Failure)
**Risk Score:** 🔴 **10/12 - CRITICAL**

**Description:**
The MVP attempts to integrate 5+ novel technologies simultaneously (Docling, Fin-E5, Contextual Retrieval, FastMCP, AWS Strands, GraphRAG, Prophet) in a 4-week Phase 1 timeline. While each technology is individually research-validated, their **combined integration complexity** is untested. Integration issues (API mismatches, version conflicts, performance degradation) could cascade and derail the timeline.

**Evidence:**
- PRD Epic 1 has 12 stories spanning PDF extraction → LLM synthesis → MCP protocol → accuracy validation
- Architecture v1.1 estimates 600-800 lines of code, but references v1.0 microservices as "future scaling" (suggests uncertainty about actual complexity)
- No prior integration testing of Docling + Fin-E5 + Contextual Retrieval + FastMCP stack

**Likelihood Triggers:**
- ✅ More than 3 technologies being integrated for the first time
- ✅ Timeline under 6 weeks for MVP with multiple novel components
- ✅ Solo developer (even with AI assistance)

**Impact If Realized:**
- Phase 1 extends from 4 weeks to 8-10 weeks
- Forced descope to basic RAG (abandon Contextual Retrieval, GraphRAG, Forecasting)
- MVP fails to meet 90% retrieval accuracy target
- **Worst case:** Complete project restart with simpler technology stack

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **IMMEDIATE (Pre-Dev):**
   - ✅ **Technology Integration Spike (Week 0):** Before formal development, spend 3-5 days building "hello world" integration:
     - Ingest 1 PDF with Docling → chunk → embed with Fin-E5 → store in Qdrant → query via FastMCP
     - Validate all technologies can communicate and basic flow works
     - Document integration gotchas and version pinning

2. **DURING PHASE 1:**
   - ✅ **Weekly Decision Gates:** End of each week, assess progress vs. plan:
     - Week 1: If ingestion not working, consider AWS Textract fallback
     - Week 2: If retrieval accuracy <70%, revisit chunking/embedding strategy
     - Week 3: If synthesis quality poor, simplify LLM prompting
   - ✅ **Descope Authority:** Pre-approve fallback scope reductions:
     - Drop Contextual Retrieval → use simple 500-word chunking
     - Drop GraphRAG → vector-only MVP
     - Drop Forecasting → defer to Phase 3+

3. **TESTING:**
   - Unit test each integration boundary separately (Docling output → Fin-E5 input, Fin-E5 output → Qdrant input)
   - Integration test full pipeline daily (not just at end of Phase 1)

**Residual Risk After Mitigation:** 🟡 MEDIUM (5/12)

### RISK-002: Accuracy Targets Unachievable 🔴 CRITICAL

**Category:** Quality & Accuracy
**Probability:** MEDIUM (50%)
**Impact:** CRITICAL (MVP Success Criteria Failure)
**Risk Score:** 🔴 **10/12 - CRITICAL**

**Description:**
The PRD mandates **90%+ retrieval accuracy** (NFR6), **95%+ source attribution accuracy** (NFR7), and **<5% hallucination rate** (NFR8). While research validates Contextual Retrieval achieves 98.1% in academic settings, **financial documents with complex tables, merged cells, and domain-specific terminology** may perform worse. If accuracy falls to 75-85%, the MVP fails its core value proposition.

**Evidence:**
- PRD NFR6: "Retrieval accuracy shall achieve 90%+ for diverse financial queries"
- PRD NFR7: "Source attribution accuracy shall be 95%+"
- PRD NFR8: "Hallucination rate shall be <5%"
- **No validation yet** on actual company financial documents (research spike was theoretical)
- Financial documents are notoriously complex (multi-level headers, footnotes, cross-references)

**Likelihood Triggers:**
- ⚠️ First accuracy test on real documents shows <80% retrieval
- ⚠️ Source attribution fails due to Docling page number extraction errors
- ⚠️ LLM hallucinates financial figures from similar-but-wrong document sections

**Impact If Realized:**
- MVP declared failed (does not meet user acceptance criteria)
- Requires 2-4 week accuracy improvement cycle
- May necessitate switching embedding models (Fin-E5 → Voyage-3-large at higher cost)
- **Worst case:** Project pivots to "document search assistant" vs. "financial intelligence platform"

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **IMMEDIATE (Week 0 Integration Spike):**
   - ✅ **Real Document Accuracy Baseline:** Test Docling + Fin-E5 + Contextual Retrieval on 3 actual company financial PDFs:
     - Create 10-15 ground truth Q&A pairs per document
     - Measure baseline retrieval accuracy BEFORE starting development
     - **Go/No-Go Decision:** If baseline <70%, reconsider approach

2. **WEEK 1-3 (During Development):**
   - ✅ **Continuous Accuracy Tracking:** Don't wait until Week 4 validation
     - Daily: Test 3-5 queries against indexed documents
     - Track accuracy trend line (should improve as system matures)
   - ✅ **Early Warning System:** If accuracy drops below 80% mid-phase:
     - HALT feature work
     - Debug root cause (chunking? embedding? LLM synthesis?)
     - Iterate on fixes before proceeding

3. **WEEK 4 (Validation):**
   - ✅ **Comprehensive Ground Truth Test Set:** 50+ queries minimum
     - Cover all query types: simple facts, multi-document synthesis, table data extraction
     - Validate source attribution separately from answer correctness
   - ✅ **Fallback Plan:** If accuracy 80-89%:
     - Acceptable for Phase 1 → proceed to Phase 2 improvements
     - If <80%: Consider adding reranking, hybrid BM25+vector search, or Voyage-3 embeddings

4. **TESTING:**
   - Create accuracy regression test suite (automated, runs daily)
   - Manual review of failed queries to categorize failure modes
   - Hallucination detection: Cross-check LLM claims against source chunks

**Residual Risk After Mitigation:** 🟡 MEDIUM (6/12)

## High Risks (P1 - Address During Phase 1)

### RISK-003: Timeline Slip Due to Unfamiliar Technologies 🟡 HIGH

**Category:** Timeline & Scope
**Probability:** MEDIUM (60%)
**Impact:** HIGH (Schedule Delay)
**Risk Score:** 🟡 **8/12 - HIGH**

**Description:**
The 4-week Phase 1 timeline assumes smooth integration of unfamiliar technologies (Docling, Fin-E5, FastMCP, AWS Strands). **Learning curves, API quirks, and debugging integration issues** historically add 30-50% to estimated timelines for solo developers. Even with Claude Code AI assistance, unknowns can derail weekly milestones.

**Evidence:**
- Architecture Section 8 (Phase 1): "Week 1-4" breakdown assumes zero integration blockers
- No buffer time allocated for debugging or rework
- Solo developer (no pair programming fallback)
- FastMCP is new technology (< 6 months old, evolving API)

**Likelihood Triggers:**
- Week 1 ingestion takes 8-10 days instead of 5 (Docling API complexity)
- Week 2 retrieval blocked by Qdrant indexing performance issues
- Week 3 LLM synthesis quality requires multiple prompt engineering iterations

**Impact If Realized:**
- Phase 1 extends to 6-7 weeks (50% overrun)
- Delayed Phase 2/3/4 start dates
- Compressed time for accuracy validation → rushed testing
- Risk of skipping test coverage to meet deadlines

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **TIMELINE REALISM:**
   - ✅ Add 20% buffer to Phase 1: Plan for 5 weeks instead of 4
   - ✅ Identify "nice-to-have" vs. "must-have" for Phase 1:
     - **Must-have:** Ingest PDFs, vector search, basic synthesis, source attribution
     - **Nice-to-have:** Contextual Retrieval (can upgrade chunking in Phase 2), Excel support (defer)

2. **WEEKLY CHECKPOINTS:**
   - End of each week: Assess actual vs. planned progress
   - If >2 days behind: Cut scope or extend week

3. **PARALLEL WORK (Where Possible):**
   - Week 1: Ingestion + Initial Qdrant setup in parallel
   - Week 2-3: Retrieval + Synthesis can prototype independently, integrate at end

**Residual Risk After Mitigation:** 🟢 MEDIUM (4/12)

---

### RISK-004: Solo Developer + AI Model Execution Risk 🟡 HIGH

**Category:** Resource & Capability
**Probability:** MEDIUM (50%)
**Impact:** HIGH (Delivery Quality/Speed)
**Risk Score:** 🟡 **7/12 - HIGH**

**Description:**
The development model relies on **solo developer + Claude Code AI pair programming** for a complex multi-technology integration project. While AI assistants accelerate development, they:
- Cannot debug novel technology integration issues without human guidance
- May generate plausible-but-incorrect code for unfamiliar libraries
- Require clear requirements and cannot make architectural decisions independently

**Solo developer risks:**
- No code review (bugs slip into production)
- Knowledge silos (if developer unavailable, project stalls)
- Burnout risk (10-12 week intensive solo project)

**Evidence:**
- Architecture acknowledges "solo developer with Claude Code as AI pair programmer" (Section Technical Assumptions)
- No mention of code review process or quality gates
- 10-12 week timeline for 600-3000 lines of critical financial software

**Likelihood Triggers:**
- AI generates FastMCP integration code that compiles but fails at runtime
- Developer stuck on obscure Docling table extraction bug for 2 days
- Code quality degrades as developer rushes to meet Phase 1 deadline

**Impact If Realized:**
- Subtle bugs in retrieval logic → incorrect answers passed to users
- Technical debt accumulates → harder to maintain in Phases 2-4
- Developer burnout → project pauses or terminates mid-stream

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **CODE QUALITY GATES:**
   - ✅ **Daily Code Review Ritual:** Even solo, review your own code end-of-day:
     - Does this make sense tomorrow morning?
     - Are error cases handled?
     - Are there unit tests?
   - ✅ **AI Code Validation:** Ask Claude Code to review generated code for bugs
   - ✅ **Linting/Type Checking:** Enforce black, isort, ruff, mypy on every commit

2. **KNOWLEDGE CAPTURE:**
   - ✅ Maintain `docs/dev-notes.md` with daily progress and gotchas
   - ✅ Comment complex integrations heavily (for future you or team members)

3. **WORKLOAD MANAGEMENT:**
   - ✅ Realistic working hours (6-8 hours/day, not 10-12)
   - ✅ Built-in slack time between phases for rest/recovery

4. **FALLBACK SUPPORT:**
   - ✅ Identify 1-2 external developers who can be consulted if stuck (paid consultants or community forums)

**Residual Risk After Mitigation:** 🟡 MEDIUM (5/12)

## Medium Risks (P2 - Monitor and Mitigate as Needed)

### RISK-005: Dependency on External APIs (Claude, Fin-E5) 🟡 MEDIUM

**Category:** Integration & Dependency
**Probability:** MEDIUM (40%)
**Impact:** MEDIUM (Service Degradation)
**Risk Score:** 🟡 **6/12 - MEDIUM**

**Description:**
RAGLite depends on **external APIs** for core functionality:
- **Claude API** for LLM synthesis, Contextual Retrieval chunking, forecasting adjustments
- **Fin-E5 embeddings** (self-hosted or external service)

**Risks:**
- Claude API rate limits hit during ingestion (50 documents × Contextual Retrieval = hundreds of API calls)
- Fin-E5 embedding service downtime or slow response times
- API cost overruns (Contextual Retrieval $0.82/100 docs × volume scaling)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. ✅ **Rate Limit Handling:** Implement exponential backoff, queue ingestion jobs
2. ✅ **Embedding Caching:** Cache embeddings to avoid redundant API calls
3. ✅ **Cost Monitoring:** Track API spend daily, alert if >$X/week
4. ✅ **Fallback:** Design for graceful degradation (skip Contextual Retrieval if Claude API down)

**Residual Risk:** 🟢 LOW (3/12)

---

### RISK-006: GraphRAG Complexity Explosion (Phase 2) 🟡 MEDIUM

**Category:** Architecture Decisions
**Probability:** MEDIUM (50% that Phase 2 triggers)
**Impact:** MEDIUM (Phase 2 extends 2-4 weeks)
**Risk Score:** 🟡 **6/12 - MEDIUM**

**Description:**
If Phase 1 accuracy <90% on multi-hop queries, **GraphRAG (Phase 2) triggers**. GraphRAG adds:
- Neo4j graph database setup and learning curve
- Entity extraction quality challenges
- Agentic graph navigation complexity
- $9 construction + $20/month ongoing costs

**Architecture correctly defers GraphRAG to Phase 2, but IF triggered:**
- Adds 4 weeks to timeline (Weeks 5-8)
- Requires learning Neo4j Cypher queries
- Entity extraction accuracy may be <95% on financial documents → bad graph quality

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. ✅ **Strict Decision Gate:** Only trigger GraphRAG if:
   - Phase 1 accuracy <90% **AND**
   - Failures are specifically multi-hop relational queries (not general retrieval issues)
2. ✅ **Prototype First:** 1-week GraphRAG spike before committing to full Phase 2
3. ✅ **Fallback:** If GraphRAG construction fails, revert to Phase 1 vector-only

**Residual Risk:** 🟢 LOW (2/12 if decision gate followed correctly)

---

### RISK-007: Insufficient Testing Coverage 🟡 MEDIUM

**Category:** Testing Infrastructure
**Probability:** MEDIUM (50%)
**Impact:** MEDIUM (Bugs in Production)
**Risk Score:** 🟡 **6/12 - MEDIUM**

**Description:**
Architecture specifies **50%+ code coverage for MVP**, but comprehensive testing requires:
- Unit tests (mocking external APIs)
- Integration tests (full pipeline)
- Accuracy tests (ground truth validation)
- Performance tests (response time benchmarks)

**Time pressure may lead to:**
- Skipping unit tests to ship features faster
- Incomplete ground truth test set (<20 queries instead of 50+)
- No performance regression testing

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. ✅ **Test-First for Critical Paths:** Write tests for retrieval accuracy, source attribution BEFORE implementation
2. ✅ **Automated Test Suite:** CI runs tests on every commit (GitHub Actions)
3. ✅ **Manual QA Checklist:** Weekly manual testing of 10 representative queries
4. ✅ **Ground Truth as First-Class Artifact:** Treat test set creation as Week 4 deliverable (not afterthought)

**Residual Risk:** 🟢 LOW (3/12 with discipline)

---

## Low Risks (P3 - Monitor Only)

### RISK-008: Data Security Breach 🟢 MEDIUM

**Category:** Security & Compliance
**Probability:** LOW (20%)
**Impact:** HIGH (Regulatory/Reputation Damage)
**Risk Score:** 🟢 **4/12 - LOW-MEDIUM**

**Description:**
Financial documents contain sensitive data. Risks include:
- Hardcoded API keys in code
- Unencrypted documents in S3
- No access controls on production MCP server

**PRD addresses this with NFR11-15 (encryption at rest, secrets management, audit logging), but implementation quality matters.**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. ✅ **Secrets Management:** Use AWS Secrets Manager (production) or .env (local) - NEVER commit secrets
2. ✅ **Encryption at Rest:** Enable S3 encryption, Qdrant encryption (Phase 4)
3. ✅ **Audit Logging:** Log all queries and answers (NFR14) for compliance
4. ✅ **Security Review:** Week 4 security checklist before production deployment

**Residual Risk:** 🟢 LOW (2/12)

---

### RISK-009: Deployment Complexity (Phase 4) 🟢 MEDIUM

**Category:** Deployment & Operations
**Probability:** LOW (30%)
**Impact:** MEDIUM (Cloud Deployment Delay)
**Risk Score:** 🟢 **4/12 - LOW-MEDIUM**

**Description:**
Phase 4 cloud deployment (AWS ECS, managed Qdrant, CloudWatch) adds operational complexity. Risks:
- Terraform IaC errors → deployment failures
- Cost overruns (Qdrant Cloud more expensive than expected)
- Performance regression (network latency between services)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. ✅ **Deployment Spike (Phase 3.5):** Test AWS deployment BEFORE Phase 4 begins
2. ✅ **Cost Estimation:** Validate $115-165/month estimate with AWS calculator
3. ✅ **Staging Environment:** Deploy to staging first, validate performance, then production

**Residual Risk:** 🟢 LOW (2/12)

---

## Risk Mitigation Roadmap

### Pre-Development (Week 0 - CRITICAL)

**MUST DO BEFORE STARTING PHASE 1:**

1. ✅ **Technology Integration Spike (3-5 days):**
   - Ingest 1 real financial PDF with Docling
   - Generate Fin-E5 embeddings
   - Store in Qdrant
   - Query via FastMCP
   - **SUCCESS CRITERIA:** End-to-end flow works, accuracy >70% on 5 test queries

2. ✅ **Accuracy Baseline Test:**
   - Create 15 ground truth Q&A pairs from 3 real financial documents
   - Measure Docling extraction + Fin-E5 retrieval accuracy
   - **GO/NO-GO:** If <70%, reconsider technology stack

3. ✅ **Timeline Realism Adjustment:**
   - Add 20% buffer: Phase 1 = 5 weeks, not 4

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-5)

**Weekly Decision Gates:**

- **End of Week 1:** Ingestion working? If not, consider AWS Textract fallback
- **End of Week 2:** Retrieval accuracy >70%? If not, debug chunking/embeddings
- **End of Week 3:** Synthesis quality good? If not, iterate on prompts
- **End of Week 4:** Accuracy validation >80%? If not, extend to Week 5 for fixes
- **End of Week 5:** FINAL GO/NO-GO for Phase 2

**Continuous Practices:**

- Daily: Test 3-5 queries, track accuracy trend
- Weekly: Code review ritual, update dev notes
- Bi-weekly: Check API cost spend vs. budget

### Phase 2 (Conditional - Weeks 6-9)

**Decision Gate:** ONLY proceed if Phase 1 accuracy <90% AND failures are multi-hop relational queries

**GraphRAG Spike (Week 6):**
- 1-week prototype: Extract entities, build graph, test navigation
- **GO/NO-GO:** If spike fails, revert to Phase 1 vector-only MVP

### Phase 3 & 4

*(Lower risk - defer detailed mitigation planning until Phase 1/2 validated)*

---

## Risk Acceptance & Escalation Criteria

### ACCEPT AS-IS (No Further Mitigation)

- RISK-008 (Data Security): Mitigations in PRD/Architecture are sufficient for MVP
- RISK-009 (Deployment): Phase 4 is far enough out to handle when closer

### MONITOR CLOSELY

- RISK-003 (Timeline Slip): Track weekly, adjust scope proactively
- RISK-005 (API Dependencies): Monitor rate limits and costs daily

### ESCALATE TO PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS IF:

1. **Phase 1 accuracy baseline <70%** (Week 0 spike) → Reconsider entire approach
2. **Phase 1 extends beyond 6 weeks** → Descope to basic RAG, defer advanced features
3. **Phase 1 validation accuracy <80%** → Extend Phase 1 or pivot strategy
4. **API costs exceed $50/month in Phase 1** → Reassess Contextual Retrieval cost/benefit

---

## Testing Strategy to Mitigate Risks

### Critical Test Coverage (Addresses RISK-002, RISK-007)

**Phase 1 Minimum Viable Test Suite:**

1. **Accuracy Validation (MANDATORY):**
   - 50+ ground truth Q&A pairs (diverse query types)
   - Automated accuracy measurement (retrieval, attribution, hallucination)
   - **Target:** 90%+ retrieval, 95%+ attribution, <5% hallucination
   - **Frequency:** Daily trend tracking + Week 4 final validation

2. **Integration Tests (MANDATORY):**
   - End-to-end pipeline: PDF → ingestion → query → answer
   - Docling → Fin-E5 → Qdrant → Claude API integration points
   - **Target:** All integrations tested with real data
   - **Frequency:** Daily CI runs

3. **Unit Tests (50%+ Coverage):**
   - Chunking logic (context preservation)
   - Source attribution formatting
   - Error handling (malformed PDFs, API failures)
   - **Target:** 50%+ code coverage (MVP), 80%+ (Phase 4)
   - **Frequency:** On every commit

4. **Performance Tests (Week 4):**
   - Query response time: <5s (p50), <15s (p95)
   - Ingestion time: <5 min for 100-page doc
   - **Target:** Meet NFR1-5 performance targets
   - **Frequency:** Weekly benchmarks

5. **Manual Exploratory Testing (Weekly):**
   - User testing with real financial questions
   - Edge case discovery (complex tables, multi-doc synthesis)
   - **Target:** Qualitative feedback on answer usefulness
   - **Frequency:** Weekly + final Week 4 validation

---

## Conclusion & Recommendations

### Overall Assessment

RAGLite is a **high-value, high-risk MVP** with excellent architectural risk mitigation (phased complexity, fallback strategies, validated technologies) but significant execution risk due to:

1. Multiple novel technologies integrated for the first time
2. Aggressive accuracy and timeline targets
3. Solo developer + AI model (untested at this complexity)

### Primary Recommendations

1. ✅ **CRITICAL: Execute Week 0 Integration Spike** - Do NOT start Phase 1 development until end-to-end integration is validated on real financial documents with >70% accuracy baseline.

2. ✅ **Extend Phase 1 Timeline:** Plan for 5 weeks (not 4) with explicit buffer for learning curves and debugging.

3. ✅ **Implement Weekly Decision Gates:** Assess progress weekly, be willing to descope advanced features (Contextual Retrieval, GraphRAG, Forecasting) if core RAG not working by Week 3.

4. ✅ **Test-First for Accuracy:** Create ground truth test set in Week 1 (not Week 4), track accuracy daily to catch issues early.

5. ✅ **Protect Code Quality:** Even with AI assistance, enforce linting, type checking, and daily self-code-review to prevent technical debt accumulation.

### Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

**PROCEED TO PHASE 1 IF:**
- ✅ Week 0 integration spike achieves >70% accuracy baseline
- ✅ End-to-end flow (PDF → Docling → Fin-E5 → Qdrant → FastMCP) demonstrated
- ✅ No showstopper integration blockers discovered

**PAUSE/REASSESS IF:**
- ⚠️ Week 0 accuracy <70% → Investigate root cause before proceeding
- ⚠️ Major API incompatibilities discovered → May need architecture revision
- ⚠️ Docling table extraction <90% accurate → Consider AWS Textract

**ABORT/PIVOT IF:**
- 🛑 Week 0 accuracy <50% → Technology stack fundamentally unsuitable
- 🛑 Integration blockers require >2 weeks to resolve → Re-architect
