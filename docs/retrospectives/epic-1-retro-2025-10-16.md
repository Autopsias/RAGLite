## Part 1: Epic 1 Review

### What Went Well

#### 💻 Amelia (Developer Agent)

**Successes:**
- ✅ **Story Context XML:** Every story had comprehensive context - eliminated guesswork, accelerated implementation
- ✅ **Incremental delivery:** 17 stories allowed for continuous integration and testing - caught issues early
- ✅ **Test-driven development:** 103 unit tests provided confidence - zero regressions across entire epic
- ✅ **Adaptive problem-solving:** Number format mismatch (American vs European) resolved with elegant normalization solution
- ✅ **Performance excellence:** Achieved 150x-237x better than NFR13 targets - 99.6% latency budget remaining

**Specific Examples:**
- Story 1.15B: Created `normalize_numbers()` function for format-agnostic comparison (American/European)
- Story 1.15: Identified TableItem export_to_markdown() solution through architecture research
- Story 1.12B: Automated validation framework enabling continuous accuracy tracking

#### 🏗️ Winston (Architect)

**Successes:**
- ✅ **Technology selection validated:** Docling proved to be best-in-class (95-98% accuracy) for financial tables
- ✅ **KISS principle enforced:** Zero over-engineering violations - direct SDK usage maintained throughout
- ✅ **Performance architecture:** Simple design achieved exceptional performance (p50=33ms)
- ✅ **Decision gates:** Path 3 determination based on real metrics prevented premature Phase 2 implementation

**Specific Examples:**
- Story 1.15: Architectural research validated Docling (vs LlamaParse, pdfplumber) - saved days of work
- Epic 1: Direct SDK usage pattern (no custom wrappers) enabled 99.6% latency budget remaining
- Story 1.15B: Decision gate logic correctly determined Epic 2 full implementation required

#### 👨‍💼 Bob (Scrum Master)

**Successes:**
- ✅ **Story preparation quality:** All 17 stories had clear ACs, tasks, and context before implementation
- ✅ **Workflow discipline:** Strict story-ready → story-context → dev-story → review-story → story-approved flow maintained
- ✅ **Developer handoff:** Story Context XML eliminated ambiguity - Amelia had everything needed for implementation
- ✅ **Correct-course workflow:** Story 1.15A/1.15/1.15B reorganization handled smoothly without disrupting sprint

**Specific Examples:**
- Story 1.6: Context XML included 5 documentation artifacts, 8 code references, 7 constraints
- Stories 1.15A-1.15B: Correct-course workflow added 4 stories mid-epic without scope creep
- All 17 stories: Zero stories blocked due to missing requirements or unclear ACs

#### 📋 John (Product Manager)

**Successes:**
- ✅ **PRD clarity:** Epic 1 PRD provided clear success criteria (NFR6, NFR7, NFR13) - measurable outcomes
- ✅ **Decision gate strategy:** Path 1/2/3 framework enabled data-driven Epic 2 activation decision
- ✅ **Baseline-first approach:** Story 1.15B prevented over-engineering - could have wasted weeks on unnecessary Epic 2 stories
- ✅ **User story quality:** All 17 stories traced back to business value - no "nice to have" work

**Specific Examples:**
- Epic 1 PRD: NFR6 (90% retrieval), NFR7 (95% attribution), NFR13 (<10s latency) all measurable
- Story 1.15B: Decision gate correctly determined Path 3 (56%/32% requires full Epic 2)
- Epic 2: Prevented premature implementation - baseline validation saved 1-2 weeks

#### 🧪 Murat (Test Architect)

**Successes:**
- ✅ **Ground truth methodology:** 50-question test set with 6 categories enabled comprehensive accuracy validation
- ✅ **Automated validation:** Story 1.12B's run-accuracy-tests.py script made validation repeatable
- ✅ **Performance tracking:** p50/p95 latency metrics revealed 99.6% budget remaining for Epic 2
- ✅ **Zero test regressions:** 103/103 tests passing throughout Epic 1 - continuous integration worked

**Specific Examples:**
- Story 1.12A: 50 ground truth queries across 6 categories (cost, margins, financial, safety, workforce, expenses)
- Story 1.12B: Automated validation script enabled Story 1.15B baseline measurement
- Story 1.15B: Adaptive number normalization fixed format mismatch - prevented false failures

### What Could Improve

#### 💻 Amelia (Developer Agent)

**Challenges:**
- ⚠️ **Initial table extraction blocker:** Story 1.15 initially blocked due to misunderstanding Docling's TableItem structure - cost 3 hours debugging
- ⚠️ **Ground truth format assumptions:** Initial 0% accuracy due to number format mismatch - should validate format assumptions earlier
- ⚠️ **Story estimation accuracy:** Some stories took longer than estimated (Story 1.15: 5h vs 2-3h estimate)

**Root Causes:**
- TableItem blocker: Assumed `.text` attribute exists on all items - didn't inspect library data structures
- Format mismatch: American number format (23.2) vs European format (23,2) not specified in architecture
- Estimation: Exploratory stories (library internals) underestimated - need research buffer

#### 🏗️ Winston (Architect)

**Challenges:**
- ⚠️ **Earlier Docling deep-dive:** Architectural research in Story 1.15 should have happened during Story 1.2 planning
- ⚠️ **Number format specification:** Architecture docs didn't specify regional number format handling - caused Story 1.15B debugging
- ⚠️ **Epic 2 pre-planning:** Could have started Epic 2 architecture during Story 1.14-1.15 to accelerate transition

**Root Causes:**
- Library evaluation: Focused on API surface, didn't inspect data structures deeply enough
- International considerations: Assumed American number formats, didn't specify regional variations
- Epic planning: Sequential epic planning instead of overlapping (Epic 2 design after Epic 1 complete)

#### 👨‍💼 Bob (Scrum Master)

**Challenges:**
- ⚠️ **Story sizing variability:** Some stories underestimated (Story 1.15: 5h vs 2-3h) - need better estimation for unknowns
- ⚠️ **Epic 1 scope creep:** Started with 13 stories, ended with 17 (Stories 1.12A, 1.13, 1.15A, 1.15B added mid-epic)
- ⚠️ **Testing story placement:** Story 1.14 (ground truth validation) should have been earlier to catch format issues sooner

**Root Causes:**
- Estimation: Didn't buffer exploratory/research stories adequately
- Scope: Correct-course workflow added 4 stories - healthy adaptation but indicates initial planning gaps
- Testing: Validation story (1.14) came late (Story 14) - should have been Story 4-5

#### 📋 John (Product Manager)

**Challenges:**
- ⚠️ **NFR realism:** Initial 90%/95% targets for Phase 1 were optimistic - 56%/32% baseline more realistic
- ⚠️ **Epic 2 preparation:** Could have drafted Epic 2 stories earlier to enable faster transition
- ⚠️ **Stakeholder communication:** No external stakeholder demos during Epic 1 - missed opportunity for feedback

**Root Causes:**
- NFR targets: Assumed basic semantic search would achieve 90% - didn't account for domain complexity
- Epic planning: Sequential epic approach - Epic 2 drafting after Epic 1 complete
- Demos: Focused on internal validation - didn't engage stakeholders until baseline complete

#### 🧪 Murat (Test Architect)

**Challenges:**
- ⚠️ **Ground truth creation timing:** Story 1.12A (test set) created late in epic - should have been earlier
- ⚠️ **Format validation:** Didn't catch American vs European number format mismatch until Story 1.15B execution
- ⚠️ **Integration test coverage:** Focus on unit tests - could have added more end-to-end MCP integration tests

**Root Causes:**
- Test set timing: Created ground truth after features built - missed continuous validation opportunity
- Format specification: Ground truth assumed American format - didn't validate against actual PDF
- Test balance: 103 unit tests excellent, but limited E2E MCP workflow tests

---

### Lessons Learned

1. **Always inspect library documentation for data structures** - Don't assume `.text` attribute exists on all items (Docling TableItem lesson)

2. **Format-agnostic comparisons for international data** - Adaptive normalization (normalize_numbers) better than manual ground truth fixes

3. **Early validation reveals reality** - Story 1.15B baseline prevented over-engineering assumptions about Epic 1 capabilities

4. **Library evaluation must include data structure inspection** - Not just API surface (Docling TableItem, export_to_markdown)

5. **International considerations upfront** - Specify number formats, date formats, currency symbols in architecture docs

6. **Overlapping epic planning** - Start next epic architecture while current epic wraps up (Epic 2 design during Stories 1.14-1.15)

7. **Pad estimates for exploratory stories** - Stories involving library internals need 50-100% buffer

8. **Front-load validation** - Data quality verification (Story 1.14) should happen before full test suite creation (Story 1.12B)

9. **Incremental story addition is healthy** - Epic 1's +4 stories improved quality vs forcing original plan

10. **Create ground truth early** - Story 1.12A should have been Story 1.4 or 1.5 to enable continuous accuracy tracking

---

## Critical Path

### BLOCKER 1: BM25 Implementation Decision
- **Owner:** Winston + Amelia
- **Must complete by:** Before Story 2.1 drafting
- **Decision needed:** Qdrant native vs `rank_bm25` library vs alternative
- **Impact if delayed:** Cannot start Story 2.1 implementation
- **Mitigation:** Start research immediately, prioritize Qdrant native

### BLOCKER 2: Tech Stack Approval (if needed)
- **Owner:** Winston → User (Ricardo)
- **Must complete by:** Before Story 2.1 implementation
- **Trigger:** IF `rank_bm25` required AND not approved
- **Impact if delayed:** Story 2.1 blocked
- **Mitigation:** Research Qdrant native first to avoid dependency

### DEPENDENCY 1: Story Context Quality
- **Owner:** Bob
- **Depends on:** Tasks 1-2 complete
- **Why critical:** Story Context XML needs accurate technical guidance
- **Mitigation:** Complete architecture research before story drafting

### DEPENDENCY 2: Parallel Story Execution
- **Owner:** Bob + Winston
- **Risk:** Stories 2.1+2.2 both modify `search.py` → merge conflicts
- **Mitigation:** Define clear module boundaries (2.1: fusion, 2.2: embedding swap)

## Team Agreements

1. **International formats specified upfront** - All future epics must document number formats, dates, currencies in architecture docs

2. **Validation test sets created early** - Ground truth should be Stories 4-5 in future epics (not Stories 12-13)

3. **Exploratory stories get estimation buffers** - Add 50-100% padding for stories involving library internals or research

4. **Epic overlap planning** - Start next epic design in final 2 stories of current epic

5. **Format-agnostic design patterns** - Reuse normalize_numbers() approach for international data handling

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1: BM25 adds >2s latency**
- Mitigation: Profile early, set p95 <200ms threshold
- Fallback: Optimize parameters (k1, b), consider caching
- Escalation: If >500ms, consult architecture

**Risk 2: Hybrid fusion strategy unclear**
- Mitigation: Implement multiple strategies, A/B test
- Fallback: Start with simple weighted sum (0.7 semantic + 0.3 BM25)
- Escalation: If unclear after spike, defer to Story 2.3

**Risk 3: Parallel stories conflict**
- Mitigation: Define clear module boundaries before implementation
- Fallback: Run sequentially if conflicts detected
- Escalation: Winston reviews module design

**Risk 4: Tech stack approval delayed**
- Mitigation: Prioritize Qdrant native BM25 evaluation
- Fallback: Use Qdrant native if available
- Escalation: Request approval immediately with justification
