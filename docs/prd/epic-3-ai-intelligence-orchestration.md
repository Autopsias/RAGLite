# Epic 3: AI Intelligence & Orchestration

**Epic Goal:** Enable multi-step reasoning and complex analytical workflows through agentic orchestration, allowing the system to autonomously execute analytical tasks requiring planning, tool use, and iterative reasoning.

## Story 3.1: Agentic Framework Integration

**As a** system,
**I want** agentic orchestration framework integrated per Architect's selection,
**so that** multi-step analytical workflows can be planned and executed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Agentic framework integrated per Architect (LangGraph, AWS Bedrock Agents, or function calling)
2. Framework configuration and initialization validated
3. Basic workflow execution tested (simple 2-step workflow)
4. State management functional for multi-step workflows
5. Error handling implemented for workflow failures (NFR24, NFR26)
6. Integration test validates framework execution
7. Documentation includes workflow development guide

## Story 3.2: Retrieval Agent Implementation

**As a** system,
**I want** specialized retrieval agent that can search financial knowledge base,
**so that** agentic workflows can access document information as a tool.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Retrieval agent defined with tool interface per Architect's agentic framework
2. Agent accepts query and returns relevant document chunks with citations
3. Agent integrates with existing retrieval logic from Epic 1
4. Agent tested in isolation (unit test)
5. Agent tested within simple workflow (integration test)

## Story 3.3: Analysis Agent Implementation

**As a** system,
**I want** specialized analysis agent that can perform calculations and reasoning over retrieved data,
**so that** analytical questions can be answered autonomously.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Analysis agent defined with capabilities: calculate percentages, trends, variances, comparisons
2. Agent accepts financial data and analysis instruction, returns analytical result
3. Agent uses LLM for reasoning with structured prompts for numerical accuracy
4. Agent tested with sample analytical tasks (YoY growth calculation, variance analysis)
5. Agent integrates with retrieval agent for data access

## Story 3.4: Synthesis Agent Implementation

**As a** system,
**I want** specialized synthesis agent that can combine results from multiple sub-tasks into coherent answer,
**so that** complex multi-step workflows produce user-friendly responses.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Synthesis agent defined to aggregate and summarize results from other agents
2. Agent produces natural language summary with source citations
3. Agent maintains consistency with original query intent
4. Agent tested with multi-source inputs
5. Agent output format optimized for MCP client display

## Story 3.5: Multi-Step Workflow Orchestration

**As a** system,
**I want** to orchestrate multi-agent workflows for complex analytical queries,
**so that** questions requiring planning and multiple steps can be answered autonomously.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Workflow planner decomposes complex queries into sub-tasks
2. Sub-tasks routed to appropriate specialized agents (retrieval, analysis, synthesis)
3. Agent outputs passed between agents as inputs to subsequent steps
4. Workflow execution completes in <30 seconds for typical analytical queries (NFR5)
5. Example workflow tested: "Calculate YoY revenue growth and explain variance" → retrieval agent (get Q3 2023 & 2024 revenue) → analysis agent (calculate % change) → retrieval agent (get context for variance) → synthesis agent (explain)
6. Workflow success rate >80% on complex test queries
7. Failed workflows fall back gracefully to simpler retrieval (NFR17, NFR32)

## Story 3.6: Analytical Query Tool (MCP)

**As a** user,
**I want** to ask complex analytical financial questions via MCP,
**so that** I can get answers requiring multi-step reasoning without manual decomposition.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. MCP tool defined: "analyze_financial_question" triggering agentic workflow
2. Tool accepts natural language analytical queries
3. Tool routes simple queries to basic retrieval, complex queries to agentic workflow
4. Responses include reasoning steps taken (transparency)
5. Test queries validated: trend analysis, variance explanation, correlation discovery
6. User testing via Claude Desktop confirms usability

## Story 3.7: Graceful Degradation for Workflow Failures

**As a** system,
**I want** to handle agentic workflow failures gracefully,
**so that** users receive useful responses even when complex workflows fail.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Workflow timeout handling (>30 seconds triggers fallback)
2. Agent failure detection and logging
3. Fallback to basic retrieval when workflow fails (NFR17, NFR32)
4. User receives partial results or error message with suggested alternative query
5. Error rates logged for workflow improvement
6. Integration test validates fallback behavior

## Story 3.8: Agentic Workflow Test Suite

**As a** developer,
**I want** to validate agentic workflows against test scenarios,
**so that** workflow reliability and accuracy are measured objectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Test set includes 15+ multi-step analytical queries
2. Automated test suite executes workflows and validates results
3. Success rate measured (target: 80%+ per FR16 interpretation)
4. Performance measured (workflow execution time)
5. Failure analysis documents reasons for unsuccessful workflows
6. Test suite covers edge cases (missing data, ambiguous queries, conflicting information)
