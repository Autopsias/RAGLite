# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable instant, natural language access to comprehensive financial knowledge from company documents
- Reduce time-to-insight for financial queries from hours/days to minutes (80% reduction)
- Validate complete RAGLite vision: retrieval → analysis → forecasting in single MVP
- Establish production-ready foundation for AI-powered financial intelligence platform
- Prove measurable ROI through time savings and improved decision quality to justify team rollout

## Background Context

Finance teams currently spend 40-60% of their time manually searching through PDFs and Excel spreadsheets to answer stakeholder questions about financial performance. This manual workflow creates decision latency (days to weeks for complex questions), limits strategic agility, and prevents proactive insight discovery. Traditional BI dashboards require predefined queries, while generic LLM tools lack persistent financial knowledge bases and domain optimization.

RAGLite addresses this gap by combining RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture with AI-powered intelligence capabilities. The system ingests financial documents into a vector database, exposes knowledge via MCP (Model Context Protocol), and layers on agentic workflows, forecasting, and proactive insight generation. The MVP validates the complete vision end-to-end: from accurate retrieval through advanced forecasting, accepting higher complexity to prove the full value proposition in a single delivery.
