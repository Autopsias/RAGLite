# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary

**Overall PRD Completeness:** 87% (Good)

**MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right (with advisory note on complexity)

**Readiness for Architecture Phase:** **READY** (with minor recommendations)

**Most Critical Observation:** The PRD appropriately defers critical technical decisions to the Architect's research spike phase, which is the correct BMAD workflow. The ambitious MVP scope is well-documented with clear validation checkpoints and fallback strategies.

## Category Analysis Table

| Category                         | Status  | Critical Issues                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context  | PASS    | None - Project Brief provides comprehensive foundation                                              |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition          | PASS    | None - Clear scope with validation checkpoints and descope options documented                       |
| 3. User Experience Requirements  | PASS    | Minor: No custom UI means limited traditional UX specs, but MCP interaction patterns well-defined   |
| 4. Functional Requirements       | PASS    | None - Comprehensive FRs with research-dependency flags and fallbacks                                |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements   | PASS    | None - Specific numeric targets with realistic ranges (MVP vs production)                           |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure        | PASS    | None - 5 epics, 51 stories, well-sequenced, sized for AI agent execution                            |
| 7. Technical Guidance            | PASS    | None - Appropriately defers decisions to Architect while providing clear constraints                |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Minor: Data retention policies "TBD", schema evolution not explicitly addressed in stories          |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS    | None - Clear language, consistent terminology, good structure                                        |

## Recommendations

**For Architect Phase:**

1. **Execute FR33 Research Spike First** - Critical path: No implementation until research spike validates all technical approaches

2. **Make Go/No-Go Decisions on Advanced Features:**
   - Knowledge Graph: Demonstrate value vs. complexity before Epic 2
   - Agentic Framework: Select approach with complexity/capability trade-off explicit
   - Forecasting: Validate accuracy achievable before Epic 4

3. **Define Architecture with Descope Flexibility:**
   - Design for Epic 1-2 "Minimum Viable RAG" fallback if Epics 3-5 prove too complex
   - Ensure architecture supports graceful degradation per NFR32

4. **Clarify Data Retention & Schema Evolution:**
   - Define retention policies or confirm defaults acceptable
   - Include schema versioning strategy (even if simple for greenfield MVP)

## Final Decision

âœ… **READY FOR ARCHITECT**

The PRD and epic structure are comprehensive, properly scoped, and ready for architectural design. The document demonstrates clear problem definition, appropriate MVP scope with validation checkpoints, comprehensive requirements, well-structured epics, and technical guidance that appropriately defers decisions to Architect while providing clear constraints.
