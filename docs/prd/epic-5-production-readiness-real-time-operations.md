   - Workflow triggers defined (push to main/develop, pull requests)
   - Parallel job execution for faster feedback (lint + test in parallel)

2. **Pre-Commit Hooks:**
   - `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configured with black, isort, ruff, mypy
   - Installation instructions in README.md
   - Hooks run automatically on `git commit` (enforce code quality locally)

3. **Linting & Formatting Stage:**
   - Black (code formatting) runs on all PRs
   - isort (import sorting) validates import organization
   - Ruff (fast linter) checks code quality
   - Mypy (type checking) validates type hints
   - **Failure action:** Block merge if linting fails

4. **Unit Test Stage:**
   - pytest runs with coverage reporting (pytest-cov)
   - Mocks external dependencies (Qdrant, Claude API)
   - **Coverage target:** 70%+ for critical paths (ingestion, retrieval, synthesis)
   - Coverage report posted as PR comment
   - **Failure action:** Block merge if tests fail or coverage <70%

5. **Integration Test Stage:**
   - Docker Compose test environment (`docker-compose.test.yml`) spins up Qdrant
   - End-to-end pipeline tests (PDF → ingestion → retrieval → synthesis)
   - Tests run in isolated environment (ephemeral containers)
   - **Failure action:** Block merge if integration tests fail

6. **Accuracy Validation Stage:**
   - Runs ground truth test set (50+ queries) on main/develop pushes only
   - Measures retrieval accuracy against known correct answers
   - **Thresholds:**
     - FAIL if accuracy <70% (block deployment, not merge)
     - WARN if accuracy <90% (target not met, investigate)
   - Uses real Anthropic API (requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret)
   - **Triggers:** Push to main/develop (not on PRs to save API costs)

7. **Docker Build & Push Stage:**
   - Builds production Docker image on main branch push
   - Tags images with `latest` and git SHA (e.g., `raglite:abc1234`)
   - Pushes to Docker Hub or AWS ECR
   - Layer caching configured for faster builds
   - **Triggers:** Push to main only

8. **Deployment Stage (Epic 5 Production):**
   - Auto-deploy to dev environment on develop branch push
   - Manual approval gate for production deployment
   - AWS ECS task definition updated with new image
   - Health checks validate deployment success
   - Rollback if health checks fail

9. **Required GitHub Secrets:**
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - For accuracy validation tests
   - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` / `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` - Docker Hub credentials
   - `CODECOV_TOKEN` - Code coverage reporting (optional)
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - AWS deployment (Epic 5)
   - Documentation in README.md for setting up secrets

10. **Pipeline Performance:**
    - Full pipeline runtime: <25 minutes (parallel job execution)
    - Pre-commit hooks: <30 seconds (local quick tests only)
    - PR feedback: <10 minutes (skip accuracy tests on PRs)

**Deliverables:**
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` fully configured and tested
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with all quality checks
- `docker-compose.test.yml` for CI integration tests
- Documentation in README.md for CI/CD setup and GitHub Secrets
- At least one successful pipeline run validated end-to-end

**Rationale:**
CI/CD is critical for solo developer + AI agent workflow:
- Automated testing prevents regressions when Claude Code generates code
- Pre-commit hooks catch issues immediately (fast feedback loop)
- Accuracy validation gates deployment (ensures 90%+ target maintained)
- Docker builds ensure dev/prod parity

## Story 5.13: API Documentation & MCP Tool Reference

**As a** developer (or future team member),
**I want** comprehensive documentation of all MCP tools and API interfaces,
**so that** I can understand and use the RAGLite system effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

     - Purpose and use case
     - Input parameters with types and descriptions
     - Output format and structure
     - Example invocations with sample responses
     - Error responses and troubleshooting

2. **Core MCP Tools Documented:**
   - `ingest_financial_document(file_path, document_type)` - Phase 1
   - `query_financial_documents(query, filters)` - Phase 1
   - `get_financial_forecast(metric, time_period)` - Phase 3 (if implemented)
   - `generate_insights(category, time_range)` - Phase 3 (if implemented)
   - Any additional tools implemented in Epics 2-4

3. **Response Format Specifications:**
   - JSON schema for tool responses
   - Source attribution format examples
   - Error response structure and codes
   - Confidence score interpretation

4. **Integration Guide:**
   - How to connect MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Claude Code) to RAGLite
   - Configuration examples for MCP client setup
   - Troubleshooting common connection issues

5. **API Versioning Strategy:**
   - Document current API version (e.g., v1.0)
   - Breaking change policy for future updates
   - Deprecation notice process

**Deliverables:**
- `docs/api-reference.md` with comprehensive MCP tool documentation
- Example tool invocations in `docs/examples/` directory
- Integration guide for MCP clients

**Rationale:**
API documentation is essential for team rollout post-MVP. While single-user MVP may not need formal docs, documenting during development prevents knowledge loss and accelerates team onboarding.

## Story 5.14: Knowledge Transfer & Team Onboarding Documentation

**As a** project lead,
**I want** comprehensive onboarding documentation for future team members,
**so that** RAGLite can be maintained and extended beyond the original developer.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

   - Prerequisites (Python 3.11+, Docker, Git)
   - Step-by-step local environment setup
   - How to run the development server locally
   - How to run tests (unit, integration, accuracy)
   - Common development workflows (adding new feature, debugging)
   - Code review checklist and quality standards

2. **Architecture Decision Record (`docs/architecture-decisions.md`):**
   - Log of key architectural decisions made during development
   - For each decision, document:
     - Context: What problem were we solving?
     - Decision: What did we choose and why?
     - Alternatives considered: What else did we evaluate?
     - Consequences: What are the trade-offs?
   - Examples:
     - Why Docling over AWS Textract?
     - Why monolithic v1.1 over microservices v1.0?
     - Why Contextual Retrieval before GraphRAG?
     - Why FastMCP over custom MCP implementation?

3. **Codebase Architecture Walkthrough:**
   - Video walkthrough (15-20 minutes) or detailed written guide
   - Repository structure explanation
   - Module responsibilities (ingestion, retrieval, synthesis)
   - Data flow diagram (PDF → chunks → embeddings → Qdrant → LLM → answer)
   - Key files and their purposes

4. **Troubleshooting & Debugging Guide:**
   - Common errors and solutions
   - How to debug retrieval accuracy issues
   - How to analyze slow query performance
   - How to investigate LLM hallucinations
   - Logging and monitoring best practices

5. **Knowledge Transfer Session (Optional):**
   - 1-hour walkthrough with first new team member
   - Q&A session to fill documentation gaps
   - Update onboarding docs based on feedback

**Deliverables:**
- `docs/developer-onboarding.md` with complete setup guide
- `docs/architecture-decisions.md` with ADR log
- `docs/codebase-walkthrough.md` or video recording
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` with common issues and solutions

**Rationale:**
Solo developer projects create knowledge silos. Documenting architecture decisions and onboarding processes during development (not after) ensures knowledge preservation and enables team scaling post-MVP.

**Note:** This story can be completed incrementally throughout Epics 1-5, with final consolidation in Epic 5.
