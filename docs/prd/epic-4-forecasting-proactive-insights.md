2. Data points extracted with timestamps and metric labels
3. Data normalized to consistent time intervals (monthly, quarterly)
4. Extraction handles various date formats and fiscal period labels
5. Extracted data validated against sample documents for accuracy
6. Integration test validates extraction from financial PDFs

## Story 4.2: Forecasting Engine Implementation

**As a** system,
**I want** to forecast key financial indicators using Architect-selected approach,
**so that** predictive insights are available to users.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Forecasting implementation per Architect (LLM-based, statistical, or hybrid)
2. Key indicators supported: revenue, cash flow, expense categories per Project Brief (FR21)
3. Forecast generation produces predictions with confidence intervals (FR19)
4. Forecast accuracy ±15% validated on historical data (NFR10)
5. Forecasting agent integrated into agentic framework
6. Unit tests cover forecasting logic
7. Integration test validates end-to-end forecast generation

## Story 4.3: Automated Forecast Updates

**As a** system,
**I want** forecasts to update automatically when new financial documents are ingested,
**so that** predictions remain current without manual intervention.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Document ingestion triggers forecast refresh for affected metrics (FR20)
2. Incremental updates avoid full recomputation when possible
3. Forecast update completes within 5 minutes of document ingestion
4. Users notified of updated forecasts if applicable
5. Integration test validates forecast refresh after new document added

## Story 4.4: Forecast Query Tool (MCP)

**As a** user,
**I want** to query financial forecasts via MCP,
**so that** I can access predictive insights conversationally.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. MCP tool defined: "get_financial_forecast" with metric and time period parameters
2. Tool returns forecast values with confidence intervals
3. Tool explains basis for forecast (historical data used, methodology)
4. Queries like "What's the revenue forecast for next quarter?" answered accurately
5. Test queries validated for accuracy and clarity

## Story 4.5: Anomaly Detection

**As a** system,
**I want** to detect anomalies and outliers in financial data,
**so that** unusual patterns are surfaced proactively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Anomaly detection algorithm implemented (statistical thresholds or ML-based per Architect)
2. Anomalies identified: significant deviations from trends, unexpected spikes/drops, outliers
3. Anomaly severity scored (minor, moderate, critical)
4. Anomalies logged with context (metric, time period, magnitude of deviation)
5. Integration test validates anomaly detection on sample data with known outliers

## Story 4.6: Trend Analysis & Pattern Recognition

**As a** system,
**I want** to identify trends and patterns in financial data,
**so that** strategic insights can be generated proactively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Trend analysis identifies: growth patterns, cyclical trends, correlations between metrics
2. Pattern recognition uses statistical analysis and/or LLM reasoning per Architect
3. Trends characterized with direction (increasing/decreasing) and magnitude
4. Trend analysis runs automatically on document ingestion or on-demand
5. Unit tests validate trend detection logic

## Story 4.7: Proactive Insight Generation

**As a** system,
**I want** to autonomously generate insights highlighting risks, opportunities, and areas requiring attention,
**so that** users learn what they should know without asking.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Insight generation combines anomaly detection, trend analysis, and contextual reasoning (FR22, FR23)
2. Insights categorized: risks, opportunities, anomalies, trends, strategic priorities
3. Insights ranked by priority/impact (FR24)
4. Insight quality validated: 75%+ rated useful/actionable by user testing (per Project Brief MVP success criteria)
5. Insights include supporting data and rationale (FR25)
6. Example insights tested: "Q3 marketing spend increased 30% YoY with no corresponding revenue increase - potential inefficiency"

## Story 4.8: Strategic Recommendation Engine

**As a** system,
**I want** to generate actionable recommendations based on financial data analysis,
**so that** users receive strategic guidance on where to focus attention.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Recommendation engine analyzes insights and generates actionable next steps (FR25)
2. Recommendations prioritized by potential impact
3. Recommendations include rationale with supporting data
4. Recommendation quality validated: align with human expert analysis 80%+ of time (per Project Brief success criteria)
5. Examples tested: "Focus on reducing cloud infrastructure costs - trending 40% over budget with minimal usage increase"

## Story 4.9: Proactive Insights Tool (MCP)

**As a** user,
**I want** to request proactive insights via MCP,
**so that** the system tells me what I should know about current financial state.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. MCP tool defined: "get_financial_insights" with optional filter parameters (category, time period)
2. Tool returns ranked list of insights with supporting data
3. Default query returns top 3-5 most important insights
4. Insights formatted for conversational display
5. User testing validates insight relevance and usefulness

## Story 4.10: Forecasting & Insights Test Suite

**As a** developer,
**I want** to validate forecasting accuracy and insight quality,
**so that** predictive capabilities meet MVP success criteria.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Forecast accuracy measured on historical data (compare predictions to actuals)
2. Accuracy meets ±15% threshold for key indicators (NFR10)
3. Insight relevance scored by user testing (target: 75%+ useful/actionable)
4. Recommendation alignment with expert analysis measured (target: 80%+)
5. Test results documented with improvement recommendations
