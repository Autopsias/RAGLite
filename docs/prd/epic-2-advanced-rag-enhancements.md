## Story 2.1: Phase 2A - Hybrid Search (FAILED - PIVOT)

**Status:** ‚ùå CLOSED - Failed AC6 (56% accuracy vs ‚â•70% target)
**Date Closed:** 2025-10-18
**Outcome:** BM25 approach inadequate for financial documents with complex tables
**Root Cause:** Whitespace tokenization destroys table structure; length normalization bias; low BM25 coverage
**Decision:** PIVOT to Stories 2.2-2.4 (element-based chunking + query preprocessing + table summarization)
**Research Evidence:** Jimeno Yepes et al. (2024), Kim et al. (ICLR 2025), Min et al. (NAACL 2024)

**Goal (Original):** Combine semantic vector search with keyword matching for precision

**Lessons Learned:**
- ‚úÖ Whitespace tokenization inadequate for financial domain (numbers split: "23.2 EUR/ton")
- ‚úÖ BM25 length normalization bias inflates short chunk scores (confidentiality notices)
- ‚úÖ Table structure lost in linear token streams (semantic coherence destroyed)
- ‚úÖ Element-based chunking required for complex financial documents
- ‚úÖ Research validation: +16.3pp page-level recall with element-aware boundaries (Jimeno Yepes et al.)

**As a** system,
**I want** to combine vector search with keyword matching and re-ranking,
**so that** queries with specific numbers or financial terms retrieve correct chunks with higher precision.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Post-search keyword re-ranking implemented** (2 hours)
   - Retrieve top-20 candidates via semantic search
   - Extract keywords from query (financial terms, numbers, units)
   - Score documents by keyword presence + semantic similarity
   - Re-rank to top-5 using combined score

2. **Scoring formula configured** (30 min)
   - Default: 70% semantic + 30% keyword (configurable)
   - Test alternative weights (80/20, 60/40) on ground truth
   - Document optimal weighting in completion notes

3. **Financial term detection** (1 hour)
   - Identify financial keywords: EBITDA, CAPEX, YTD, margins, EUR/ton
   - Boost scores for exact matches on numeric values
   - Case-insensitive matching for terms

4. **Integration with existing search** (30 min)
   - Update `retrieval/search.py` to support hybrid mode
   - Add `enable_hybrid` parameter to search functions
   - Default: hybrid=True for production

5. **Unit tests** (1 hour)
   - Test keyword extraction from queries
   - Test scoring formula variations
   - Test re-ranking logic

6. **Integration tests** (1 hour)
   - Test queries with exact numbers (e.g., "23.2 EUR/ton")
   - Verify correct chunks in top 3 (vs. semantic-only top 10)
   - Measure accuracy improvement on ground truth

7. **Accuracy validation** (30 min)
   - Run full ground truth test (50 queries)
   - Measure: Retrieval accuracy with hybrid search
   - Target: ‚â•92% (up from 85-89% baseline)

### Expected Impact

- +5-10% retrieval accuracy (better for queries with specific numbers/terms)
- Queries with "23.2", "50.6%", "EBITDA" will find correct chunks in top 3
- No latency impact (post-search re-ranking is fast)

### Decision Gate

- **IF ‚â•92%:** Continue to Story 2.2 (Financial Embeddings)
- **IF ‚â•95%:** STOP - Phase 2 complete, proceed to Epic 3

**Technologies:** Qdrant SDK (no new dependencies)

**Files Modified:**
- `raglite/retrieval/search.py` (+80 lines)
- `tests/unit/test_retrieval.py` (+100 lines)
- `tests/integration/test_retrieval_integration.py` (+80 lines)

## Story 2.2: Phase 2B - Element-Based Chunking Enhancement (1 week)

**Status:** ‚úÖ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION (Priority: HIGH - Critical path after Story 2.1 pivot)
**Research Foundation:** Jimeno Yepes et al. (2024) arXiv:2402.05131, Kim et al. (ICLR 2025) arXiv:2503.15191
**Detailed Specification:** `docs/stories/story-2.2-element-chunking.md` (1,144 lines)

**Goal:** Replace fixed 512-token chunking with structure-aware boundaries (tables, sections, paragraphs) using Docling's element detection

**As a** RAG system processing financial documents,
**I want** structure-aware chunking that respects element boundaries,
**so that** chunks preserve semantic coherence and improve retrieval accuracy from 56% to 64-68%.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Element-Aware Chunk Boundaries** (AC1) ‚≠ê CRITICAL
   - Chunks MUST NOT split tables mid-row (tables are indivisible units)
   - Chunks MUST NOT split section headers from their content
   - Tables <2,048 tokens stored as single chunk
   - Sections >512 tokens split at paragraph boundaries (not mid-sentence)

2. **Chunk Metadata Enhancement** (AC2) ‚≠ê CRITICAL

   - Add `section_title` field for context (e.g., "Revenue by Segment")
   - Preserve existing fields: `page_number`, `chunk_index`, `source_document`

3. **Retrieval Accuracy Validation** (AC3) ‚≠ê CRITICAL - DECISION GATE
   - Run 50-query ground truth test suite
   - **MANDATORY:** Retrieval accuracy ‚â•64.0% (32/50 queries pass) - minimum viable improvement
   - **TARGET:** Retrieval accuracy ‚â•68.0% (34/50 queries pass) - research-backed stretch goal
   - Attribution accuracy ‚â•45.0% (maintain or improve over 40% baseline)

4. **Performance & NFR Compliance** (AC4)
   - Ingestion time ‚â§30s per 100 pages (same as baseline)
   - Memory usage ‚â§4 GB during ingestion
   - p95 retrieval latency <10,000ms (NFR13)

5. **Backward Compatibility** (AC5)
   - Qdrant collection schema remains compatible (additive changes only)
   - `hybrid_search()` API signature unchanged
   - Existing queries work without modification

### Expected Impact

- **Accuracy:** 56% ‚Üí 64-68% (+8-12pp conservative, based on Jimeno Yepes et al.)
- **Table Queries:** +15-25% improvement on number-heavy queries
- **Semantic Coherence:** Tables and sections preserved intact
- **Research Evidence:** +16.3pp page-level recall, +24.8% ROUGE, +80.8% BLEU (arXiv:2402.05131)

**Detailed Specification:** `docs/epic-2-preparation/implementation-plan-stories-2.2-2.4.md` (lines 236-428)

**Goal:** Implement pre-retrieval query enhancement and post-retrieval optimization without fine-tuning embeddings

**Target Accuracy:** 68% ‚Üí 74-76% (+6-8pp)
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM
**Effort:** 2 weeks

**As a** RAG system handling financial queries,
**I want** query preprocessing (financial acronym expansion, number normalization) and retrieval optimization (metadata boosting, chunk bundling),
**so that** retrieval accuracy improves from 68% to 74-76%.

### Key Features

1. **Query Rewriting for Financial Terms**
   - Expand acronyms: "EBITDA" ‚Üí "EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)"
   - Normalize numbers: "23.2" ‚Üí "23.2 | twenty-three point two"
   - Expand units: "EUR/ton" ‚Üí "EUR/ton | euros per ton"

2. **Metadata-Aware Filtering**
   - Number-heavy queries prioritize `element_type="table"` results
   - Trend queries ("change", "growth") expand to adjacent time periods
   - Section-aware boosting: "revenue" query boosts `section_title="Revenue"` chunks

3. **Chunk Bundling for Context**
   - Retrieve top-20 candidates, expand each with ¬±1 adjacent chunk (same section)
   - Re-rank expanded bundles using similarity threshold (tau=0.7)
   - Return top-5 after bundling

### Decision Gate

- **IF <74%:** Continue to Story 2.4 (Table Summarization)
- **IF ‚â•74% AND <70% original target:** Consider stopping (reassess Epic 2 target)
- **IF ‚â•74% AND meets 70% Epic 2 target:** MAY STOP (Epic 2 complete)

**Target Accuracy:** 74% ‚Üí 78-80% (+4-6pp)
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM
**Effort:** 3 weeks
**Cost:** ~$0.60 per 160-page document (Claude 3.7 Sonnet API)

**As a** RAG system processing complex financial tables,
**I want** LLM-generated table summaries stored alongside raw tables,

2. **Dual Chunk Storage**
   - Store TWO chunks per table: (1) Raw Markdown table, (2) LLM summary
   - Link via `parent_chunk_id` metadata field
   - Enables both structured and semantic table retrieval

3. **Cost & Performance Monitoring**
   - Track API token usage per table
   - Monitor summarization latency (target: <5s per table)
   - Budget: <$10 per full corpus re-ingestion

### Decision Gate

## Decision Gates Summary

### NEW Approach (Post-Pivot, 2025-10-18)

| Story | Expected Accuracy | Decision |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| **Baseline (Post-Epic 1)** | 56.0% | PIVOT to element-based approach |
| **2.1 (Hybrid Search)** | 56.0% ‚ùå | FAILED - whitespace tokenization inadequate ‚Üí PIVOT |
| **2.2 (Element Chunking)** | 64-68% | IF <65% ESCALATE; IF ‚â•68% high confidence to 2.3 |
| **2.3 (Query Preprocessing)** | 74-76% | IF ‚â•70% MAY STOP (Epic 2 target met); else continue to 2.4 |
| **2.4 (Table Summarization)** | 78-80% | Epic 2 COMPLETE (exceeds 70% target) |

**Most Likely Outcome:** STOP after Story 2.3 or 2.4 with 74-80% accuracy ‚úÖ

### OLD Approach (Pre-Pivot - ARCHIVED)

The following progression assumed 90%+ baseline and is now DEFERRED:

| Story | Expected Accuracy | Status |
|-------|------------------|--------|
| 2.5 (OLD 2.3 - Table-Aware) | 95-97% | ARCHIVED - see NEW Story 2.2 |
| 2.6 (OLD 2.4 - Cross-Encoder) | 96-98% | DEFERRED to Phase 3+ |
| 2.7 (OLD 2.5 - Query Expansion) | 96-98% | DEFERRED to Phase 3+ |
| 2.8 (OLD 2.6 - Multi-Vector) | 98%+ | DEFERRED to Phase 3+ |

## Epic 2 Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- ‚úÖ Epic 1 complete (Stories 1.1-1.15B)
- ‚úÖ Story 1.15B baseline validation executed
- ‚úÖ Baseline <90% retrieval OR <95% attribution (triggers Epic 2)

**Blocks:**
- Epic 3 (Intelligence Features) - needs Epic 2 complete if baseline <90%

---

## Rationale

**Why Epic 2 is Conditional:**
- Prevents over-engineering if baseline already meets NFR6/NFR7
- Allows data-driven decision based on Story 1.15B results
- Incremental approach with decision gates maximizes efficiency

**Why Sequential Implementation:**
- Test after EACH enhancement to measure impact
- STOP when 95% achieved (prevent unnecessary work)
- Each story builds on previous improvements

**Why These 6 Stories:**
- Based on RAG best practices and research
- Proven techniques for improving retrieval accuracy
- Incremental complexity (simple ‚Üí advanced)
