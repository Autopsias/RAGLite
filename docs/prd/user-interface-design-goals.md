# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

**Conversational-First Financial Intelligence Interface**

RAGLite delivers financial intelligence through natural language conversation via MCP-compatible clients (Claude Desktop initially). The UX prioritizes:
- **Instant comprehension** - Users ask questions in plain language without learning query syntax
- **Trust through transparency** - Every answer includes verifiable source attribution
- **Progressive disclosure** - Simple queries get simple answers; complex analysis revealed through follow-up
- **Proactive guidance** - System surfaces insights users should know, not just what they ask

**Assumption:** MCP client provides the UI; RAGLite provides the intelligence layer and structured responses optimized for conversational display.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

**1. Natural Language Query-Response**
- Users ask financial questions conversationally ("What drove the Q3 revenue variance?")
- System responds with synthesized answer + source citations
- No forms, buttons, or structured UI - pure conversational flow

**2. Source-Attributed Transparency**
- Every factual claim includes document reference (name, page, section)
- Format: "[Answer] (Source: Q3_Financial_Report.pdf, page 12, Revenue Analysis section)"
- Users can verify claims by checking source documents

**3. Multi-Turn Analytical Conversations**
- System maintains context across questions
- Users drill down: "What about marketing specifically?" follows "What drove Q3 variance?"
- Agentic workflows handle multi-step reasoning invisibly

**4. Proactive Insight Surfacing**
- System volunteers strategic insights: "I noticed 3 anomalies in Q3 expenses worth reviewing..."
- Users can accept insight or dismiss
- Insights ranked by priority/impact

## Core Screens and Views

**Note:** Since RAGLite has no custom UI, "screens" here refer to conversational interaction patterns and response formats:

**1. Query Interface (MCP Client Native)**
- User types natural language question in Claude Desktop or compatible MCP client
- No RAGLite-specific UI needed

**2. Answer Display Format (Text Response)**
- Synthesized answer (2-3 paragraphs max)
- Bulleted key findings for complex questions
- Source attribution footer
- Confidence indicator for forecasts/insights

**3. Multi-Document Synthesis View (Structured Text)**
- Comparative tables when synthesizing across documents
- Clear delineation: "Q2 vs Q3" or "Company A vs Company B"
- Source per data point

**4. Forecast/Insight Display (Structured Response)**
- Visual text representation of trends ("Revenue trending up 12% MoM")
- Confidence interval clearly stated ("Â±10% accuracy")
- Supporting data points and rationale

**5. Error/Clarification Prompts**
- Clear "I cannot answer because..." messages
- Suggested alternative questions or missing context
- Guidance on refining unclear queries

## Accessibility

**Level: N/A - No Custom UI**
- Accessibility responsibility lies with MCP client (Claude Desktop, etc.)
- RAGLite ensures text responses are screen-reader friendly (structured, clear, no visual-only formatting)
- Alt-text approach: All responses are text-native; no images or charts in MVP

## Branding

**Minimal Technical Branding**
- System identifies as "RAGLite Financial Intelligence"
- Responses maintain professional, analytical tone (no playful language)
- No visual branding needed - purely functional conversational interface
- Future consideration: Custom web UI could incorporate company branding (post-MVP)

## Target Device and Platforms

**Primary: Desktop (MCP Client)**
- Claude Desktop on macOS (development/MVP)
- Any MCP-compatible client (desktop-focused)

**Future: Web Responsive (Post-MVP)**
- Custom web UI for team access (Phase 2+)
- Responsive design for tablet/mobile if custom UI built

**MVP Constraint:** No mobile-specific design - desktop MCP client sufficient for single-user validation
