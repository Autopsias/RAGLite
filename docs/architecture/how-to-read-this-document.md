# üìñ How to Read This Document

This architecture document presents **TWO approaches**:

## ‚≠ê v1.1 MONOLITHIC APPROACH (SECTIONS 1-9) - **START HERE FOR MVP**
**Recommended for:** Solo developer, 4-5 week MVP, Claude Code pair programming
- Sections 1-9 below define the simplified monolithic architecture
- 600-800 lines of code, single deployment
- All PRD features delivered, 80% less complexity
- **Use this for Phase 1-3 development**

## üìö v1.0 MICROSERVICES REFERENCE (SECTIONS 10+) - **Future Scaling Guide**
**Use when:** Phase 4+ if you have proven scale problems
- Detailed in later sections (Microservices Architecture, Orchestration, etc.)
- Reference architecture for when you need independent service scaling
- **Don't build this until you have REAL scaling needs**

**For MVP Development: Follow v1.1 (Sections 1-9 below)**
