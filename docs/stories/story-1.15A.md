# Story 1.15A: PDF Ingestion Completion & Quick Diagnostic

**Status:** Ready for Review
**Epic:** 1 - Foundation & Accurate Retrieval
**Priority:** HIGH - Prerequisite for Epic 1 validation
**Duration:** 1-1.5 hours
**Assigned:** Dev Agent (Amelia)
**Prerequisite:** Story 1.14 (NEW ground truth created)

---

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to complete PDF ingestion for all 160 pages and run quick diagnostic tests on the 0% accuracy issue,
**so that** I can identify the root cause and prepare for full Epic 1 validation.

---

## Context

**Current State:**
- ✅ Story 1.14: NEW ground truth created (50 validated questions)
- ✅ Structural validation: 100% PASS
- ✅ Partial PDF ingestion: 73 points (pages 1-80 of 160)
- ❌ Accuracy tests: 0% - keyword matching issue identified
- ⏸️ Story 1.15: Full validation pending (requires complete ingestion first)

**Blockers Identified:**
1. Incomplete PDF ingestion (pages 81-160 missing)
2. 0% accuracy needs diagnostic analysis before full fix
3. Uncertainty about root cause (test script vs retrieval vs keywords)

**Goal:** Unblock Story 1.15 by completing ingestion and identifying exact root cause of 0% accuracy through quick diagnostic tests.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Complete PDF ingestion for all 160 pages**
   - Ingest pages 81-160 (parts 3-4 from split PDFs)
   - Verify: ≥147 points in Qdrant (full PDF coverage)
   - Confirm: All question pages (46, 47, 77, 108) are indexed
   - Validate: No duplicate chunks, correct page number range

2. **Run quick diagnostic on 0% accuracy**
   - Test 3-5 representative queries manually
   - Check: Are retrieved chunks from correct pages?
   - Check: Do chunks contain expected keywords?
   - Verify: Is retrieval working at all (non-zero results)?

3. **Identify root cause category**
   - Determine: Test script issue vs. retrieval issue vs. keyword mismatch
   - Document: Specific failure mode with examples
   - Recommend: Fix approach for Story 1.15 or follow-up

4. **Document findings in completion notes**
   - Ingestion stats (point count, page coverage, duration)
   - Diagnostic results (query examples, retrieval quality)
   - Root cause analysis summary
   - Recommended next steps

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Task 1: Complete PDF Ingestion (30-40 minutes)

**Subtask 1.1: Verify current state** (5 min)
```bash
python scripts/inspect-qdrant.py
```
- [x] Check current point count (should be ~73 for pages 1-80)
- [x] Identify which pages are missing (expect: 81-160)
- [x] Verify collection exists and is accessible

**Subtask 1.2: Ingest remaining pages** (20-25 min)
```bash
# DECISION: Switched to whole PDF ingestion for cleaner approach
uv run python scripts/ingest-pdf.py  # (Original split PDF approach)
# ACTUAL: Ingested whole PDF in one operation
```
- [x] Wait for ingestion to complete (16 minutes for 160 pages)
- [x] Monitor progress logs
- [x] Verify: No errors or warnings during ingestion

**Subtask 1.3: Verify complete ingestion** (5-10 min)
```bash
python scripts/inspect-qdrant.py
```
- [x] Verify: ≥147 points total (full 160-page PDF) ✅ 147 points
- [x] Check: Page range is 1-160 (all valid) ✅ Pages 1-160
- [x] Confirm: Pages 46, 47, 77, 108 are all indexed ✅ All present
- [x] Validate: No unexpected page numbers or duplicates ✅ Clean data

### Task 2: Quick Diagnostic Tests (20-30 minutes)

**Subtask 2.1: Manual query test** (10 min)
Test 3 queries from different categories:
- [x] Query 1 (Cost Analysis): "What is the variable cost per ton for Portugal Cement?"
  - Expected page: 46
  - Expected keywords: "23.2", "EUR/ton", "variable costs"
  - ✅ Retrieval executed (scores: 0.83-0.85)
  - ❌ Page 46 NOT in results (got pages 47, 33, 44, 31, 73)
  - ❌ Keywords missing (only "variable costs" found, no numbers)

- [x] Query 13 (Margins): "What is the EBITDA IFRS margin for Portugal Cement?"
  - Expected page: 46
  - Expected keywords: "50.6%", "EBITDA", "margin"
  - ✅ Retrieval executed (scores: 0.85-0.87)
  - ❌ Page 46 NOT in results (got pages 47, 32, 81, 141, 44)
  - ❌ Keywords missing (only generic "EBITDA"/"margin", no percentages)

- [x] Query 21 (Financial): "What was the EBITDA for Portugal in August 2025?"
  - Expected page: 77
  - Expected keywords: "104,647", "EBITDA", "portugal"
  - ✅ Retrieval executed (scores: 0.83-0.84)
  - ❌ Page 77 NOT in results (got pages 60, 47, 59, 34, 61)
  - ❌ Keywords missing (only generic "portugal", no numbers)

**Subtask 2.2: Analyze retrieval results** (10-15 min)
For each query:
- [x] Document: Retrieved page numbers (see Completion Notes)
- [x] Document: Similarity scores (0.83-0.87 across all queries)
- [x] Document: Keyword matches found (generic keywords only, no specific values)
- [x] Document: Chunk text relevance (headers/footers present, data missing)

**Subtask 2.3: Identify failure pattern** (5 min)
- [ ] Pattern A: Chunks retrieved but keywords don't match → Keyword issue
- [x] **Pattern B: Wrong pages retrieved → Retrieval/chunking issue** (BUT root cause is table extraction, not retrieval)
- [ ] Pattern C: No chunks retrieved (empty results) → Critical retrieval failure
- [x] Document: Pattern B observed, but deeper analysis reveals DATA EXTRACTION failure

### Task 3: Root Cause Analysis (10-15 minutes)

**Subtask 3.1: Hypothesis testing**
- [x] **Hypothesis A:** Test script expects exact keyword matches, but chunks have paraphrased content
  - Check: Read chunk text vs. expected_keywords
  - Evidence: ❌ REJECTED - Chunks don't have data at all (not paraphrased)

- [x] **Hypothesis B:** Retrieval returns wrong pages due to embedding/chunking issues
  - Check: Page numbers in results vs. expected pages
  - Evidence: ✅ PARTIALLY CORRECT - Pages seem wrong, BUT root cause is table extraction

- [x] **Hypothesis C:** Keywords too specific (e.g., "23.2 EUR" vs "23.2" or "EUR/ton")
  - Check: Partial keyword matches vs. full phrase matches
  - Evidence: ❌ REJECTED - Search for "23.2" returns ZERO chunks (data not extracted)

**Subtask 3.2: Document root cause**
- [x] Identify: **DATA EXTRACTION FAILURE** (Docling extracts headers/footnotes but NOT table cells)
- [x] Explain: Financial data in table cells not captured during PDF processing
- [x] Recommend: Configure Docling table extraction OR use alternative method (pdfplumber, camelot)

**Subtask 3.3: Estimate fix effort**
- [x] Estimated effort: **2-3 hours** (config investigation + re-ingestion + validation)
- [x] Breakdown: 1h research + 30min implementation + 1h re-ingestion + 30min validation

## Testing

**Manual Verification:**
- PDF ingestion complete: 147+ points covering pages 1-160
- Sample queries return results (even if accuracy is low)
- Retrieved chunks are readable and page-attributed

**Diagnostic Validation:**
- At least 3 queries tested manually
- Root cause hypothesis documented with evidence
- Fix approach recommended with effort estimate

---

## Success Criteria

Story 1.15A is COMPLETE when:
1. ✅ PDF ingestion complete (≥147 points, pages 1-160)
2. ✅ 3-5 diagnostic queries tested manually
3. ✅ Root cause identified (test script vs. retrieval vs. keywords)
4. ✅ Findings documented in completion notes
5. ✅ Recommended fix approach provided for Story 1.15

**Quality Gate:** AC3 (root cause identification) is mandatory. Cannot proceed to Story 1.15 without understanding why accuracy is 0%.

---

## Rollback Plan

**Scenario 1: Ingestion Fails for Pages 81-160**
- **Action:** Check error logs, verify PDF files exist
- **Next Steps:**
  - Re-run ingestion with debug logging
  - If PDF corrupted, validate PDF integrity
  - If timeout, increase ingestion batch size
- **Fallback:** Use partial PDF (pages 1-80 only) for diagnostic

**Scenario 2: All 3 Test Queries Return Empty Results**
- **Action:** Critical retrieval failure - escalate to Story 1.15
- **Next Steps:**
  - Check Qdrant connectivity
  - Verify embedding model loaded correctly
  - Test basic Qdrant search manually
- **Fallback:** Skip diagnostic, proceed directly to full investigation in Story 1.15

**Scenario 3: Root Cause Remains Unclear After Diagnostic**
- **Action:** Document uncertainty, list multiple hypotheses
- **Next Steps:**
  - Proceed to Story 1.15 for deeper investigation
  - Use systematic debugging in Story 1.15 Task 2
- **Fallback:** Mark Story 1.15A as "partial completion" with diagnostic data

## Dev Notes

### Requirements Context

**Story Purpose:** Quick diagnostic story to unblock Story 1.15 full validation

**Why Story 1.15A Exists:**
- Story 1.15 has 4 major tasks (2-3 hours each)
- Completing ingestion and diagnosing root cause can be done in 1-1.5 hours
- Provides critical information before committing to full investigation
- Allows faster iteration if fix is simple (test script adjustment)

**Architecture Alignment:**
- Uses existing ingestion pipeline (Story 1.13 fix already applied)
- Uses existing validation scripts (Story 1.12B)
- No code changes expected - purely diagnostic

**NFR Targets (for reference, not validated in this story):**
- NFR6: 90%+ retrieval accuracy (validated in Story 1.15)
- NFR7: 95%+ attribution accuracy (validated in Story 1.15)
- NFR13: <10s response time (already meeting: p50=25ms, p95=53ms)

### Project Structure Notes

**Files to Use:**
- `scripts/ingest-pdf.py` - Ingest remaining PDF pages
- `scripts/inspect-qdrant.py` - Verify ingestion completion
- Manual queries via Claude Code MCP client (no script needed)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Qdrant: 147+ points (up from 73)

### Completion Notes

**Completed:** 2025-10-14 by Dev Agent (Amelia)

**PDF Ingestion Results:**
- Initial point count: 73 (pages 1-80 from Story 1.14)
- **DECISION:** Switched from split PDFs to whole PDF for cleaner ingestion
- Final point count: **147** ✅ (target: 147+)
- Page coverage: **1-160** ✅ (full PDF)
- Unique pages indexed: 146 (page 2 likely blank/title)
- Critical pages verified: ✅ 46, 47, 77, 108 all indexed
- Ingestion duration: **16 minutes** (951.86 seconds)
- Ingestion method: Whole PDF (`docs/sample pdf/2025-08 Performance Review CONSO_v2.pdf`)
- Errors: None

**Diagnostic Test Results:**

**Query 1 (Cost Analysis):** "What is the variable cost per ton for Portugal Cement in August 2025 YTD?"
- Expected page: 46
- Expected keywords: "variable costs", "23.2", "EUR/ton", "20.3", "29.4"
- Retrieved pages: 47, 33, 44, 31, 73
- Similarity scores: 0.8470, 0.8466, 0.8398, 0.8358, 0.8342
- Keywords found: "variable costs" (page 33 only) - NO specific numbers
- Chunk relevance: Related topics but MISSING expected data
- **Finding:** Expected page 46 NOT in top 5, specific values absent

**Query 13 (Margins):** "What is the EBITDA IFRS margin percentage for Portugal Cement?"
- Expected page: 46
- Expected keywords: "EBITDA IFRS margin", "50.6%", "53.2%", "40.6%"
- Retrieved pages: 47, 32, 81, 141, 44
- Similarity scores: 0.8718, 0.8686, 0.8564, 0.8528, 0.8489
- Keywords found: Generic "EBITDA", "margin" - NO specific percentages
- Chunk relevance: Related topics but MISSING expected data
- **Finding:** Expected page 46 NOT in top 5, specific values absent

**Query 21 (Financial Performance):** "What is the EBITDA for Portugal operations in Aug-25 YTD?"
- Expected page: 77
- Expected keywords: "EBITDA portugal", "104,647", "108,942", "94,845", "thousand EUR"
- Retrieved pages: 60, 47, 59, 34, 61
- Similarity scores: 0.8419, 0.8372, 0.8334, 0.8318, 0.8301
- Keywords found: Generic "portugal" - NO specific numbers
- Chunk relevance: Related topics but MISSING expected data
- **Finding:** Expected page 77 NOT in top 5, specific values absent

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Primary failure mode:** Hypothesis B (Wrong pages retrieved) - BUT root issue is DATA EXTRACTION, not retrieval
- **Technical explanation:** Docling PDF processing extracts table headers and footnotes as TEXT, but does NOT extract table CELL DATA (numerical values). Financial metrics (costs, margins, EBITDA) are in table cells and are completely missing from indexed chunks.
- **Evidence:**
  1. Page 46 indexed correctly ✅
  2. Page 46 contains expected section ("Portugal Cement YTD vs Budget vs LY") ✅
  3. Page 46 chunk contains ONLY headers and footnotes, NO table data ❌
  4. Search for "23.2" returns ZERO chunks (value not extracted) ❌
  5. Retrieval system working (similarity scores 0.83-0.87) ✅
  6. Ground truth validated against PDF, but table data not in chunks ❌
- **Pattern:** ALL 3 queries failed because expected numerical data is absent from ingested chunks

**Recommended Fix:**
- **Fix approach:** Configure Docling to extract table data OR use alternative table extraction method
- **Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours
  - 1h: Investigate Docling table extraction settings/capabilities
  - 30min: Test alternative approaches (pdfplumber, camelot, or Docling config)
  - 30-60min: Re-ingest PDF with corrected table extraction
  - 30min: Validate with ground truth queries
- **Next steps for Story 1.15:**
  1. Task 1: Research Docling table extraction configuration
  2. Task 2: Implement table-to-text conversion or alternative extractor
  3. Task 3: Re-ingest PDF (147 points → likely 300+ points with table data)
  4. Task 4: Run full accuracy validation (expect 70%+ baseline)

**Key Findings:**
1. **Clean ingestion strategy:** Whole PDF (160 pages) vs. split PDFs (4 files) is simpler and more reliable
2. **Retrieval system intact:** Fin-E5 embeddings and Qdrant search working correctly (good similarity scores)
3. **Data quality issue:** Problem is UPSTREAM in ingestion pipeline (Docling table extraction), not downstream in retrieval
4. **Ground truth valid:** Manual validation was correct, but ingestion pipeline didn't capture the data
5. **Optimization opportunity:** Docling parallel processing could reduce ingestion time ~50% (951s → ~500s)
6. **Page attribution correct:** Story 1.13 fix successful (pages 1-160 correctly attributed)

## 🚀 Next Session: Story 1.15 Implementation Plan

**Story 1.15A Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Diagnostic finished, root cause identified

**For Next Session (Story 1.15):**

### Critical Context from Story 1.15A
- **Problem:** Docling extracts table headers/footnotes but NOT table cell data
- **Impact:** Financial metrics (23.2 EUR/ton, 50.6% margin, EBITDA values) completely missing from chunks
- **Current State:** 147 chunks indexed, pages 1-160, but NO numerical data from tables
- **Retrieval System:** ✅ Working correctly (0.83-0.87 similarity scores)

### Required Actions for Story 1.15

**Task 1: Fix Table Extraction (1-1.5 hours)**
1. Research Docling table extraction capabilities:
   - Check Docling documentation for table-to-text conversion options
   - Look for `TableFormer` or table extraction settings in `DocumentConverter`
   - Investigate if Docling has built-in table handling
2. If Docling supports tables:
   - Configure `DocumentConverter` to extract table cells as text
   - Test on single page (e.g., page 46) to verify extraction
3. If Docling doesn't support tables adequately:
   - **Alternative A:** Use `pdfplumber` for table extraction + merge with Docling text
   - **Alternative B:** Use `camelot-py` for table extraction + merge with Docling text
   - **Alternative C:** Use `tabula-py` for table extraction + merge with Docling text

**Task 2: Update Ingestion Pipeline (30-45 min)**
- Modify `raglite/ingestion/pipeline.py` to extract table data
- Ensure table data is converted to searchable text
- Preserve page attribution for table cells
- Update chunking to include table rows/cells

**Task 3: Re-Ingest PDF (15-20 min)**
- Clear Qdrant collection (delete 147 existing points)
- Re-ingest whole PDF with table extraction enabled
- Expected result: 300+ chunks (147 text + ~150-200 table cells)
- Verify: Search for "23.2" returns results from page 46

**Task 4: Validate Fix (30 min)**
- Run 3 diagnostic queries from Story 1.15A again
- Verify: Page 46 and 77 now in top 5 results
- Verify: Specific keywords found ("23.2", "50.6%", "104,647")
- Quick accuracy check: Expect 50-70% accuracy on sample queries

**Task 5: Full Validation (1-1.5 hours)**
- Run full ground truth test (50 queries)
- Measure retrieval accuracy (target: ≥90%)
- Measure attribution accuracy (target: ≥95%)
- Generate validation report

**Task 6: Epic 1 Sign-Off (if validation passes)**
- Document final accuracy metrics
- Update Epic 1 status to COMPLETE
- Prepare for Phase 3 (Intelligence Features)

### Files to Modify in Story 1.15
- `raglite/ingestion/pipeline.py` - Add table extraction logic
- `scripts/ingest-pdf.py` - May need update for new pipeline
- `docs/stories/story-1.15-accuracy-test-validation.md` - Update with results
- `docs/qa/epic-1-final-validation-report.md` - Create final report

### Expected Outcomes for Story 1.15
- ✅ Table data extracted and searchable
- ✅ 300+ chunks indexed (up from 147)
- ✅ Retrieval accuracy ≥90%
- ✅ Attribution accuracy ≥95%
- ✅ Epic 1 validation complete
- ✅ GO decision for Phase 3

### Quick Reference: Why 0% Accuracy
- **NOT a retrieval issue** - Fin-E5 + Qdrant working correctly
- **NOT a keyword issue** - Ground truth validated against PDF
- **ROOT CAUSE:** Table cell data missing from Docling extraction
- **FIX:** Enable/implement table-to-text conversion in ingestion
