# Story 0.1: Week 0 Integration Spike

## Status
**Ready for Review** (QA fixes applied, re-review requested)

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to validate end-to-end technology integration on real financial documents BEFORE starting Phase 1,
**so that** I can identify showstopper issues early and establish accuracy baseline.

**Duration:** 3-5 days
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Blocks all Phase 1 work
**Type:** Integration Spike (throwaway prototype, not production code)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Ingest 1 real company financial PDF (100+ pages) with Docling - **Test PDF available at:** `/Users/ricardocarvalho/DeveloperFolder/RAGLite/docs/sample pdf`
2. Generate embeddings with Fin-E5 model
3. Store vectors in Qdrant via Docker Compose
4. Implement basic MCP server (FastMCP) exposing query tool
5. Create 15 ground truth Q&A pairs from test document
6. Measure baseline retrieval accuracy (vector search only, no LLM synthesis)
7. Document integration issues, API quirks, version conflicts discovered
8. Establish performance baseline (ingestion time, query latency)

**Success Criteria (GO/NO-GO for Phase 1):**
- ✅ **GO:** Baseline retrieval accuracy ≥70% (10+ out of 15 queries return relevant chunks)
- ✅ **GO:** End-to-end pipeline functional (PDF → Docling → Fin-E5 → Qdrant → FastMCP)
- ✅ **GO:** No major integration blockers requiring >2 days to resolve
- ⚠️ **REASSESS:** Accuracy 50-69% → Investigate root cause, may need chunking/embedding adjustments
- 🛑 **NO-GO:** Accuracy <50% → Technology stack unsuitable, consider alternatives (AWS Textract, different embeddings)

**Deliverables:**
- Working integration spike codebase (throwaway prototype, not production)
- Week 0 Spike Report documenting: accuracy baseline, integration issues, recommendations
- Updated Phase 1 plan based on learnings

```

**Reference full production structure:** [Source: architecture/3-repository-structure-monolithic.md]

**Note:** This is a throwaway prototype. Production code in Phase 1 will follow the full monolithic structure with proper module organization (`raglite/ingestion/`, `raglite/retrieval/`, etc.).

### Integration Details

#### Docling Integration
- Install via pip: `pip install docling`
- Extract text and tables from financial PDFs
- Preserve table structure (rows, columns, headers, merged cells)
- Expected accuracy: 97.9% table cell accuracy
- **Watch for:** Version conflicts, GPU requirements (if any), memory usage on large PDFs
- [Source: architecture/4-research-findings-summary-validated-technologies.md#41-document-processing]

#### Fin-E5 Embedding Integration
- **Model:** `intfloat/e5-large-v2` (finance-adapted variant)
- **Installation:** `pip install sentence-transformers`
- **Usage Example:**
  ```python
  from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
  model = SentenceTransformer('intfloat/e5-large-v2')
  embeddings = model.encode(["Financial text here"])
  ```
- **Output Dimensions:** 1024 (verify for Qdrant collection configuration)
- **Expected Performance:** 71.05% NDCG@10 on financial retrieval
- **Watch for:** Model download size (~1.3GB), inference time, batch processing requirements
- [Source: architecture/4-research-findings-summary-validated-technologies.md#41-document-processing]

#### Qdrant Integration
- Deploy via Docker Compose: `docker-compose up -d`
- Create collection with vector dimensions matching Fin-E5 output
- Use cosine distance metric
- Store chunks with metadata: `{text: str, source: str, page: int, section: str}`
- **Watch for:** Connection issues, collection configuration, indexing performance
- [Source: architecture/7-data-layer.md#71-qdrant-vector-database]

#### FastMCP Server Integration
- Official MCP Python SDK
- Implement single tool: `query_financial_documents(query: str) -> List[Dict]`
- Tool should return: relevant chunks with metadata (NO LLM synthesis in spike)
- **Watch for:** Protocol compliance, tool discovery, error handling
- [Source: architecture/4-research-findings-summary-validated-technologies.md#44-mcp-server-fastmcp]

### Performance Baselines to Establish

1. **Ingestion Time:** Time to process 100-page PDF (target: <5 minutes per NFR2 from PRD)
2. **Embedding Generation Time:** Time to generate embeddings for all chunks
3. **Query Latency:**
   - p50 (median) response time
   - p95 response time
   - Target: Sub-5 seconds (architecture requirement)
4. **Retrieval Accuracy:** % of 15 test queries returning relevant chunks (target: ≥70% for GO)

[Source: architecture/8-phased-implementation-strategy-v11-simplified.md#week-0-integration-spike]

### Risk Mitigation Context

This spike exists because:
- **RISK-001:** High probability of integration failures with novel technology stack
- **RISK-002:** Accuracy shortfalls may require technology pivots
- Week 0 validation de-risks Phase 1 by surfacing issues early when pivoting is cheap
- If spike fails (accuracy <50%), alternative technologies can be explored without wasting 5 weeks

[Source: docs/prd/epic-1-foundation-accurate-retrieval.md#story-01]

### Known Limitations (Expected for Spike)

This spike intentionally excludes:
- ❌ **No LLM synthesis** - Only vector search, no answer generation
- ❌ **No Excel support** - PDF only
- ❌ **No Contextual Retrieval** - Basic chunking only
- ❌ **No production code quality** - Quick validation, not maintainable code
- ❌ **No comprehensive error handling** - Minimal viable validation
- ❌ **No CI/CD** - Local execution only

**Rationale:** Focus on validating core integration (Docling → Fin-E5 → Qdrant → FastMCP) before investing in production features.

### Testing

#### Test File Location
- `tests/ground_truth.json` - 15 Q&A pairs with expected answers
- `tests/test_accuracy.py` - Accuracy measurement script

#### Test Standards
- Create 15 representative financial queries from test document
- Each query should have: `{question: str, expected_answer: str, source_page: int}`
- **Example Query Format:**
  ```json
  {
    "question": "What was the total revenue in Q3 2024?",
    "expected_answer": "$45.2 million",
    "source_page": 12
  }
  ```
- Queries should cover diverse financial topics (revenue, expenses, forecasts, tables, etc.)
- Accuracy measurement: Count queries where retrieved chunks contain expected answer
- Success threshold: 10+ out of 15 queries (≥70%)

#### Testing Framework
- Use pytest for test execution
- Manual validation acceptable for spike (automated testing in Phase 1)
- Focus on end-to-end validation, not unit testing
- [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

#### Accuracy Validation Approach
1. Run query through MCP server
2. Receive top-k chunks (k=5 recommended)
3. Manually verify if ANY returned chunk contains information to answer query
4. Mark as ✅ (accurate) or ❌ (inaccurate)
5. Calculate accuracy: (✅ count / 15) * 100%
6. Document failure modes for queries that fail

### Decision Gate Criteria

**After completing spike, evaluate against these criteria:**

| Criteria | Threshold | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Retrieval Accuracy | ≥70% | ✅ **GO** - Proceed to Phase 1 |
| End-to-end Integration | Functional | ✅ **GO** - All components working |
| Major Blockers | <2 days to fix | ✅ **GO** - Risks manageable |
| Retrieval Accuracy | 50-69% | ⚠️ **REASSESS** - Debug before Phase 1 |
| Retrieval Accuracy | <50% | 🛑 **NO-GO** - Reconsider technology stack |

[Source: architecture/8-phased-implementation-strategy-v11-simplified.md#week-0-integration-spike]

### Recommended Approach

**Day 1-2:**
- Set up environment (Docker, Python, dependencies)
- Ingest PDF from `/Users/ricardocarvalho/DeveloperFolder/RAGLite/docs/sample pdf` with Docling, validate extraction quality
- Implement basic chunking
- Generate embeddings with Fin-E5

**Day 3:**
- Set up Qdrant container
- Store vectors in Qdrant
- Verify storage and basic search

**Day 4:**
- Implement FastMCP server with query tool
- Create 15 ground truth Q&A pairs
- Run accuracy tests

**Day 5:**
- Measure performance baselines
- Document integration issues
- Write Week 0 Spike Report
- Make GO/NO-GO recommendation

### Expected Deliverable: Week 0 Spike Report

**Report should include:**
1. **Executive Summary:** GO/NO-GO recommendation
2. **Accuracy Results:** X out of 15 queries successful (Y% accuracy)
3. **Performance Baselines:** Ingestion time, embedding time, query latency
4. **Integration Issues:** List of problems encountered and solutions
5. **Technology Validation:**
   - Docling: Did it extract tables accurately?

   - FastMCP: Did MCP protocol work as expected?
6. **Recommendations for Phase 1:**
