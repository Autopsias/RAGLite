**Evidence:** Lines 13-15
```xml
<asA>QA engineer</asA>
<iWant>comprehensive accuracy validation</iWant>

**[✓ PASS] Item 7: Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns**

**Evidence:** Lines 163-170 - 6 constraints

1. **KISS Principle:** No custom test frameworks, use pytest with standard fixtures
2. **Direct SDK Usage:** Use rank_bm25.BM25Okapi, qdrant_client directly (no wrappers)
3. **Decision Gate MANDATORY:** AC2 ≥70% is non-negotiable Epic 2 success criterion
4. **Failure Analysis CONDITIONAL:** AC4 only if AC2 <70% (15% probability)
5. **Code Size Target:** ~380-480 lines total across 4 test files
6. **Performance Thresholds:** p50 <5s (target), p95 <15s (MANDATORY NFR13)
