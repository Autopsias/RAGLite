- **HIGH (2):**
  - C3: Batch processing MUST use batch_size=32 for memory efficiency
  - C4: Performance target <2 minutes for 300-chunk document
- **MEDIUM (3):**
  - C5: Model singleton pattern (load once, reuse)
  - C6: Follow Stories 1.2-1.4 patterns (async/await, type hints, logging)
  - C7: Add to existing raglite/ingestion/pipeline.py (KISS principle)
- **LOW (1):**

## Failed Items

**None** - No checklist items failed validation.

---

## Partial Items

### Item 2: Acceptance Criteria Formatting (⚠ Minor)

**Issue:** AC8 has minor formatting difference between XML and markdown:
- XML: `**CRITICAL - VALIDATION:**`
- Markdown: `**🚨 CRITICAL - VALIDATION:**`

**What's Missing:** Emoji symbol (🚨) in XML representation

**Impact:** Negligible - This is purely a visual formatting difference. The content is 100% accurate and semantically identical. The XML correctly captures the criticality of the requirement with text formatting.

**Recommendation:** Accept as-is. The XML format appropriately uses text emphasis instead of emoji for better parsing compatibility. No action required.

---

## Recommendations

### Must Fix
**None** - All critical requirements met.

### Should Improve
**None** - All important elements properly documented.

### Consider
1. **Optional Enhancement:** If visual consistency is desired, could add emoji to XML AC8. However, this is not recommended as XML formats should prioritize parsing compatibility over visual symbols.
