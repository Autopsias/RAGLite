## What Went Wrong?

**The system finds relevant content but NOT the exact pages expected by ground truth.**

### Example Failure:
- **Query:** "What is the variable cost per ton for Portugal Cement in August 2025 YTD?"
- **Expected Page:** 46
- **Retrieved Pages:** 42, 30, 17, 43, 15
- **Similarity Score:** 0.679 (decent relevance)
- **Result:** ‚ùå FAIL (correct answer not in top-5)

### Root Cause Hypotheses:

1. **Ground Truth Calibration Issue** (Most Likely)
   - Expected page numbers may not align with where Docling actually extracted data
   - PDF page numbering vs extraction page numbering mismatch
   - Need manual verification of pages 46, 47, 77, 108

2. **Fixed Chunking Side Effects** (Story 2.3)
   - 512-token fixed chunks may split critical information across chunks
   - Table data spanning multiple pages gets fragmented

3. **BM25 Weight Imbalance**
   - Current alpha=0.7 (70% semantic, 30% keyword) may be insufficient
   - Keyword matching may need higher weight for precise page targeting

4. **Table Detection Gaps**
   - Many failed queries target financial tables
   - Tables may be split across pages during extraction

## What Worked?

‚úÖ **Test Infrastructure:**
- 465-line test suite executed flawlessly (4.1s duration)
- Conftest fixture correctly preserved full 176-chunk PDF
- JSON export for failure analysis generated successfully

‚úÖ **Query Performance:**
- Average latency: ~30ms
- p95 latency: ~45ms (well below <15s target)
- NFR13 (query performance) fully compliant

‚úÖ **Hybrid Search Quality:**
- Similarity scores in 0.6-0.8 range (decent semantic matching)
- System IS finding relevant content
- Just not the exact pages ground truth expects

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Proceed to Phase 2B (RECOMMENDED)

**Epic 2 Phase 2B: Structured Multi-Index**

**Effort:** 3-4 weeks (15-20 story points)

**Stories:**
1. Story 2.6: PostgreSQL Schema + Metadata Tables (3 days)
2. Story 2.7: Hybrid Qdrant + PostgreSQL Search (4 days)
3. Story 2.8: Cross-Encoder Reranking (2 days)
4. Story 2.9: AC3 Re-validation ‚â•75% (2-3 days)

**Expected Outcome:**
- Target accuracy: 70-80%
- Approach: Research-validated (PostgreSQL metadata + Qdrant vectors + cross-encoder reranking)
- Risk: Medium (proven approach)

**Why This Works:**
- Structured tables in PostgreSQL for precise entity/metric matching
- Cross-encoder reranking for page-level accuracy
- Hybrid search combines structured + semantic + keyword signals

---

### Option B: Investigate Ground Truth First (LOW COST, MAY UNBLOCK)

**Effort:** 1-2 days

**Tasks:**
1. **Manual PDF Inspection:**
   - Open PDF in Acrobat/Preview
   - Verify pages 46, 47, 77, 108 contain expected answers
   - Check if Docling page numbers match PDF page numbers

2. **Chunk-to-Page Mapping Audit:**
   - Query Qdrant for chunks containing known answers
   - Verify `page_number` payload is correct
   - Check if answers span multiple chunks

3. **Failure Pattern Analysis:**
   - Categorize 41 failures: table queries, multi-hop, entity-based, temporal
   - Identify systematic vs random failures
   - Determine if clustered around specific pages or query types

**Potential Outcomes:**
- **Best Case:** Ground truth pages are wrong ‚Üí recalibrate ‚Üí retest ‚Üí may hit 70%
- **Worst Case:** Ground truth is correct ‚Üí confirms need for Phase 2B
- **Time Lost:** 1-2 days (acceptable risk vs 3-4 week Phase 2B commitment)

**RECOMMENDATION:** Execute Option B FIRST before committing to Phase 2B.

---

### Option C: Accept Failure & Pivot (NOT RECOMMENDED)

Accept 18% accuracy and pivot away from RAG approach.

**Consequences:**
- NFR6 (90%+ accuracy) will NOT be achievable
- Epic 3-5 cannot proceed (depend on ‚â•70% Epic 2 completion)
- Project pivot required (rearchitect with different approach)

**Risk:** HIGH - Invalidates entire Epic 2 effort and project roadmap

---

## PM Decision Required

**Question:** Which option should we pursue?

- ‚òê **Option A:** Proceed to Phase 2B (3-4 weeks, ~$30-40K cost)
- ‚òê **Option B:** Investigate ground truth first (1-2 days, ~$2-3K cost) ‚Üê **RECOMMENDED**
- ‚òê **Option C:** Accept failure and pivot strategy

**Recommended Path:**
1. Execute Option B investigation (1-2 days)
2. IF ground truth issues found ‚Üí recalibrate and retest
3. IF ground truth confirmed correct ‚Üí proceed to Option A (Phase 2B)

**Decision By:** [PM to specify date]

- Search: Hybrid (alpha=0.7, Fin-E5 + BM25)
- Metadata: LLM contextual summaries (Story 2.4)

## Context for Next Developer

**You're picking up after a DECISION GATE FAILURE.** The test infrastructure is solid, the PDF is ingested correctly, and hybrid search works. The problem is **page-level accuracy** - we're finding relevant content but not the exact pages ground truth expects.

**Before diving into Phase 2B:**
1. Manually verify pages 46, 47, 77, 108 in the PDF contain the expected answers
2. Check if Docling's page numbering matches the PDF's page numbering
3. Query Qdrant to see what chunks actually contain the expected answers

**If ground truth is correct:**
- Phase 2B (Structured Multi-Index) is the right path
- 3-4 weeks effort for 70-80% accuracy target
- Research-validated approach

**If ground truth needs recalibration:**
- Update `tests/fixtures/ground_truth.py` with correct page numbers
- Rerun: `bash scripts/run-ac2-decision-gate.sh`
- May hit 70% without Phase 2B

**Key Files:**
- Story status: `docs/stories/story-2.5.md`
- Test suite: `tests/integration/test_ac3_ground_truth.py`
- Ground truth: `tests/fixtures/ground_truth.py`
- Results: `docs/stories/AC1-ground-truth-results.json`

Good luck! üöÄ
