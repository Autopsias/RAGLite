## Failed Items

**None** - All issues have been resolved.

## Resolved Items

### AC2 Terminology Inconsistency (✅ FIXED)

**Original Issue:** Mismatch between story AC2 text and technical specification

**Story AC2 (line 101) - BEFORE:**
```
Values: "table", "section", "paragraph", "list", "mixed"
```

**Story AC2 (line 101) - AFTER:**
```
Values: "table", "section_header", "paragraph", "list", "mixed"
```

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Updated docs/stories/story-2.2-element-chunking.md line 101
- ✅ Now matches ElementType enum definition in technical spec
- ✅ Consistent terminology across story, XML context, and technical specification

**Impact of Fix:**
- Prevents developers from using incorrect value `"section"`
- Ensures integration tests use correct filter `element_type="section_header"`
- Maintains consistency in Qdrant payload field values

---

## Recommendations

### 1. ✅ COMPLETED: AC2 Terminology Correction

**Action:** Update story-2.2-element-chunking.md to align AC2 with technical specification
**Status:** RESOLVED - Story AC2 now uses `"section_header"` (matches ElementType enum)
**Location:** docs/stories/story-2.2-element-chunking.md:101

### 2. Should Improve: Cross-Reference Validation

**Action:** Add explicit cross-reference between AC2 and ElementType enum definition
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Suggestion:** In AC2, add note: "See Technical Specification section 1.1 for ElementType enum definition"
**Status:** OPTIONAL - Story context XML already provides complete interface definitions

### 3. Consider: Test Coverage for Terminology

**Action:** Add test case to validate element_type values match ElementType enum
**Priority:** LOW (good practice)
**Example:** `test_element_type_values_match_enum()` to prevent drift
**Status:** OPTIONAL - Good defensive practice during implementation

---

## Validation Conclusion

The Story Context XML for Story 2.2 is **100% complete and READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**.

### Strengths:
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation artifacts (8 docs, all relevant)
- ✅ Complete code artifact mapping (8 files with clear modification intent)
- ✅ Excellent interface definitions (7 contracts with signatures)
- ✅ Strong constraint coverage (9 rules from architecture + CLAUDE.md)
- ✅ Robust testing section (11 test ideas mapped to ACs)
- ✅ Clear task breakdown (7-day implementation timeline)
- ✅ Terminology consistency across all documents (AC2 fixed)

### Issues Resolved:
- ✅ AC2 terminology inconsistency FIXED (changed "section" to "section_header")

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. ✅ **COMPLETED:** AC2 terminology fix in story markdown
2. **Ready to Start:** Begin Day 1 implementation tasks
3. **During Implementation:** Use Story Context XML as single source of truth
