## Dev Notes

### Patterns from Story 1.2 (PDF Ingestion)

**Proven Approach (MUST Follow):**
- Same file structure: Add `extract_excel()` function to `raglite/ingestion/pipeline.py`
- Same error handling patterns: FileNotFoundError, RuntimeError with context
- Same logging patterns: Structured logging with `extra={'filename', 'sheet_count', ...}`
- Same data model: Return DocumentMetadata compatible with existing pipeline
- Same testing patterns: Mock external libraries, 100% coverage for critical path

**Architecture Alignment:**
```python
# raglite/ingestion/pipeline.py pattern
async def extract_excel(file_path: str) -> ExtractedContent:
    """
    Extract data from Excel file using openpyxl + pandas.

    Args:
        file_path: Path to Excel file (.xlsx or .xls)

    Returns:
        ExtractedContent with sheet data, metadata, sheet numbers

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If file doesn't exist
        RuntimeError: If Excel parsing fails
    """
    logger.info("Extracting Excel file", extra={"path": file_path})

    try:
        import openpyxl
        import pandas as pd

        # Load workbook
        workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook(file_path, data_only=True)

        # Extract all sheets
        sheets_data = []
        for sheet_idx, sheet_name in enumerate(workbook.sheetnames, start=1):
            sheet = workbook[sheet_name]

            # Convert to pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation
            data = sheet.values
            cols = next(data)  # First row as headers
            df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=cols)

            # Convert to markdown table format (compatible with chunking)
            sheet_markdown = f"## Sheet: {sheet_name}\n\n"
            sheet_markdown += df.to_markdown(index=False)

            sheets_data.append({
                "sheet_name": sheet_name,
                "sheet_number": sheet_idx,
                "content": sheet_markdown,
                "row_count": len(df)
            })

        # Combine all sheets into single document
        full_text = "\n\n".join([s["content"] for s in sheets_data])

        return ExtractedContent(
            doc_id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
            full_text=full_text,
            pages=len(sheets_data),  # Use sheet count as "pages"
            char_count=len(full_text),
            tables=[],  # Excel sheets are inherently tabular
            table_count=len(sheets_data),
            metadata={"sheets": sheets_data}
        )

    except FileNotFoundError:
        raise
    except openpyxl.utils.exceptions.InvalidFileException as e:
        logger.error("Invalid Excel file", extra={"path": file_path}, exc_info=True)
        raise RuntimeError(f"Excel parsing failed for {file_path}: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error("Excel extraction failed", extra={"path": file_path}, exc_info=True)
        raise RuntimeError(f"Unexpected error extracting Excel: {e}")
```

### Project Structure Notes

**Current Structure (from Story 1.2):**
```
raglite/
├── ingestion/
│   ├── __init__.py          # [EXISTS] Module exports
│   └── pipeline.py          # [EXISTS] ~130 lines with PDF ingestion
├── shared/                  # [EXISTS] Core infrastructure
│   ├── config.py
│   ├── models.py           # DocumentMetadata, ChunkMetadata models
│   ├── clients.py
│   └── logging.py
└── tests/
    ├── conftest.py          # [EXISTS] Test fixtures
    ├── test_ingestion.py    # [EXISTS] 7 PDF tests
    ├── test_ingestion_integration.py  # [EXISTS] Integration tests
    └── fixtures/
        └── sample_financial_report.pdf  # [EXISTS]
```

**Changes for Story 1.3:**
```
raglite/
├── ingestion/
│   └── pipeline.py          # [MODIFY] Add extract_excel() function (~50 lines)
└── tests/
    ├── test_ingestion.py    # [MODIFY] Add 7 Excel tests
    ├── test_ingestion_integration.py  # [MODIFY] Add Excel integration test
    └── fixtures/
        └── sample_financial_data.xlsx  # [ADD] Sample Excel for testing
```

**Line Count Budget:**
- Current pipeline.py: ~130 lines (Story 1.2)
- Add Excel extraction: +50 lines
- New total: ~180 lines (within 150-line module budget with some flexibility)

### Technology Stack

**Approved Libraries (from Tech Stack):**
- **openpyxl:** Excel file parsing (.xlsx, .xls)
- **pandas:** Data manipulation, type preservation, markdown table generation

**Usage Pattern:**
```python
import openpyxl  # Load Excel files
import pandas as pd  # DataFrame operations

# Load workbook
wb = openpyxl.load_workbook(file_path, data_only=True)  # data_only=True: computed values

# Per-sheet extraction
for sheet_name in wb.sheetnames:
    sheet = wb[sheet_name]
    data = sheet.values
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    # Preserve formatting
    markdown = df.to_markdown()  # Converts to markdown table (compatible with chunking)
```

### Source Attribution Requirements (NFR7)

**CRITICAL:** Excel chunks MUST include sheet_number for citations

**Citation Format:**
```
(Source: Financial_Data.xlsx, Sheet: Revenue_Analysis, Row: 12)
```

**Implementation:**
- Store sheet_name and sheet_number in chunk metadata
- Use sheet_number as equivalent to page_number in PDF chunks
- Validate sheet_number != None in unit tests (same pattern as Story 1.2)

### Lessons Learned from Story 1.2

**What Worked:**
- ✅ Mock-based unit tests (7 tests, 100% coverage, <12s execution)
- ✅ Structured logging with `extra={}` (no reserved keyword conflicts)
- ✅ Pydantic models for type safety (DocumentMetadata)
- ✅ Separate integration tests marked with `@pytest.mark.slow`
- ✅ Diagnostic scripts for troubleshooting (test_page_extraction.py pattern)

**Patterns to Reuse:**
- Same testing structure: 7 unit tests + 1 integration test
- Same error handling: FileNotFoundError, RuntimeError with context
- Same logging pattern: Structured context via `extra={}`
- Same async pattern: `async def extract_excel()` for consistency

**No Conflicts or Deviations:** Story 1.2 validation passed QA with no issues

### Testing Standards

**Test Coverage Target:** 80%+ for critical path (Excel extraction is critical)

**Test Execution:**
```bash
# Run Excel ingestion tests only
uv run pytest raglite/tests/test_ingestion.py::test_extract_excel -v

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest raglite/tests/test_ingestion.py --cov=raglite.ingestion

# Run integration tests (slow)
uv run pytest -m slow
```

**Test Scenarios (7 unit tests):**
1. Success: Valid multi-sheet Excel file
2. Multi-sheet handling: 3+ sheets extracted correctly
3. Numeric formatting: Currencies, percentages, dates preserved
4. File not found: FileNotFoundError raised
5. Password-protected: RuntimeError with clear message
6. Corrupted file: RuntimeError with context
7. Sheet number extraction: Verify sheet_number != None

**Integration Test (1 test):**
- Real Excel file (sample_financial_data.xlsx with 3 sheets)
- Validates: Sheet extraction, numeric formatting, sheet numbers
- Marked with `@pytest.mark.slow`

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Ricardo
**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

### Outcome: **APPROVE** ✅

Story 1.3 is **approved for merge** with outstanding implementation quality. All acceptance criteria met, comprehensive test coverage achieved, and code follows established patterns perfectly.

---

### Summary

Story 1.3 successfully implements Excel document ingestion with multi-sheet support, numeric formatting preservation, and comprehensive error handling. The implementation follows proven patterns from Story 1.2 (PDF ingestion), uses only approved tech stack libraries (openpyxl + pandas), and includes 13 tests (8 Excel unit + 4 router unit + 1 integration) with 100% pass rate.

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ **All 9 acceptance criteria validated** with corresponding tests
- ✅ **Zero test failures** (19/19 unit tests passing, 5.81s execution)
- ✅ **Perfect architecture alignment** (no over-engineering, direct SDK usage)
- ✅ **Excellent error handling** (specific exceptions, structured logging, graceful degradation)
- ✅ **Strong NFR7 support** (sheet numbers extracted for source attribution)
- ✅ **Comprehensive edge case coverage** (password-protected, corrupted, empty workbooks)

---

### Key Findings

#### High Priority: None ✅
No blocking issues found. Implementation is production-ready for Phase 1.

#### Medium Priority: None ✅
No medium-severity issues found.

#### Low Priority (Enhancements)

**1. Async Pattern Consistency** (Low - Enhancement)
- **Location:** `raglite/ingestion/pipeline.py:183` (`extract_excel`)
- **Finding:** Function is marked `async def` but contains no `await` operations (openpyxl and pandas are synchronous)
- **Impact:** Minimal - maintains consistency with `ingest_pdf` pattern for future async operations
- **Recommendation:** Document rationale in docstring or consider sync implementation. Current approach is acceptable for consistency.
- **Not Blocking:** Follows established pattern from Story 1.2

**2. Empty Sheet Metrics** (Low - Enhancement)
- **Location:** `raglite/ingestion/pipeline.py:276-282`
- **Finding:** Empty sheets are logged individually but not aggregated in final metrics
- **Impact:** Minimal - metrics would be helpful for debugging but not critical
- **Recommendation:** Consider adding `skipped_sheets` count to final log extra context
- **Not Blocking:** Current logging is sufficient for MVP

---

### Architectural Alignment

**✅ Perfect Alignment with Architecture Constraints**

1. **Tech Stack Compliance:**
   - Uses ONLY approved libraries: openpyxl 3.1 + pandas 2.0 ✅
   - No unapproved dependencies added ✅
   - Follows tech stack table from `5-technology-stack-definitive.md` ✅

2. **Anti-Over-Engineering Rules:**
   - ✅ NO custom wrappers (uses openpyxl and pandas directly)
   - ✅ NO abstract base classes
   - ✅ NO configuration frameworks beyond Pydantic Settings
   - ✅ NO custom decorators
   - Direct SDK usage throughout (`openpyxl.load_workbook`, `df.to_markdown()`)

3. **Story 1.2 Pattern Reuse:**
   - ✅ Same file structure (`pipeline.py` extension)
   - ✅ Same error handling (FileNotFoundError, RuntimeError with context)
   - ✅ Same logging patterns (structured with `extra={}`, avoids 'filename' keyword)
   - ✅ Same data model (DocumentMetadata with page_count = sheet_count)
   - ✅ Same testing patterns (mocked unit tests + integration test with real file)

4. **Code Quality Standards:**
   - ✅ Type hints on all functions (`file_path: str -> DocumentMetadata`)
   - ✅ Google-style docstrings with Args/Returns/Raises/Example sections
   - ✅ Structured logging with context (`extra={'doc_filename', 'sheet_count', 'duration_ms'}`)
   - ✅ Specific exceptions (FileNotFoundError, RuntimeError, ValueError)
   - ✅ Async/await pattern (consistent with ingest_pdf)

5. **Line Count Budget:**
   - `pipeline.py`: 349 lines total (was ~180, added ~169 for Excel)
   - Within acceptable range for ingestion module (~150 target with flexibility)
   - Well-structured with clear separation of concerns

---

### Security Notes

**No Security Issues Found** ✅

**Security Review:**
- ✅ **Path Traversal:** File paths validated with `Path.resolve()` (line 206)
- ✅ **File Injection:** No unsafe file operations or shell commands
- ✅ **Password Protection:** Handled gracefully without exposing sensitive info
- ✅ **Input Validation:** File existence checked before processing
- ✅ **Error Disclosure:** Error messages don't leak system internals
- ✅ **Dependency Security:** openpyxl and pandas are well-maintained, no known CVEs
- ✅ **Denial of Service:** No recursion or unbounded loops (sheet iteration is finite)

**Recommendations:** None - security posture is excellent for MVP

---

### Best-Practices and References

**Python Excel Processing (pandas.pydata.org):**
- ✅ Uses `pd.DataFrame` for tabular data (standard practice)
- ✅ Uses `df.to_markdown()` for format preservation (correct approach)
- ✅ Uses `data_only=True` in `load_workbook` to get computed values (recommended)

**Async/Await Patterns:**
- Current: Async function with no await operations
- Rationale: Maintains consistency with `ingest_pdf` for future async operations (e.g., streaming large files)
- Acceptable for MVP - no performance impact

**Structured Logging Best Practices:**
- ✅ Avoids reserved LogRecord attributes (uses 'doc_filename' not 'filename')
- ✅ Uses JSON-serializable extra context
- ✅ Includes exc_info=True for error stack traces
- Follows lesson learned from Story 1.2

**Testing Best Practices:**
- ✅ Comprehensive mocking strategy (openpyxl.load_workbook, DataFrame)
- ✅ Clear test names describing scenario
- ✅ Proper use of pytest fixtures (tmp_path for temp files)
- ✅ Integration test with real file for end-to-end validation
