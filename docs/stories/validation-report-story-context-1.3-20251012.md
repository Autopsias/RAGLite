---

### ✓ Item 5: Relevant code references included with reason and line hints

**Status:** PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 136-169

**Code Artifacts Count:** 4

**Artifacts:**
1. **ingest_pdf function** (pipeline.py:18-131)
   - Signature: `async def ingest_pdf(file_path: str) -> DocumentMetadata`
   - Reason: Reference implementation to follow for extract_excel()

2. **DocumentMetadata class** (models.py:9-20)
   - Signature: `class DocumentMetadata(BaseModel): filename, doc_type, ingestion_timestamp, page_count, source_path`
   - Reason: Data model for ingestion results, Excel must return compatible structure

3. **Chunk class** (models.py:22-33)
   - Signature: `class Chunk(BaseModel): chunk_id, content, metadata, page_number, embedding`
   - Reason: Excel chunks must populate page_number with sheet_number for NFR7 attribution

4. **get_logger module** (logging.py)
   - Signature: `get_logger(__name__) -> Logger`
   - Reason: Structured logging utility for all Excel extraction events

**Quality Attributes (all artifacts include):**
- ✓ File path
- ✓ Artifact kind (function/class/module)
- ✓ Symbol name
- ✓ Line numbers (where applicable)
- ✓ Function signature
- ✓ Explicit reason for relevance

**Sample Entry (artifact #1, lines 137-144):**
```xml
<artifact>
  <path>raglite/ingestion/pipeline.py</path>
  <kind>function</kind>
  <symbol>ingest_pdf</symbol>
  <lines>18-131</lines>
  <signature>async def ingest_pdf(file_path: str) -> DocumentMetadata</signature>
  <reason>Reference implementation to follow for extract_excel(). Same structure: async, type hints, Path.resolve(), FileNotFoundError, RuntimeError, structured logging, DocumentMetadata return.</reason>
</artifact>
```

**Assessment:** Code references are precisely targeted and actionable. Line numbers enable quick navigation. Reasons explicitly connect artifacts to implementation needs. The inclusion of the ingest_pdf reference implementation (Story 1.2) provides a proven pattern for developers to follow, reducing implementation risk.

---

### ✓ Item 6: Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable

**Status:** PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 210-254

**Interface Count:** 3

**Interfaces Defined:**

1. **extract_excel (new function)** - Lines 211-233
   - Kind: async function
   - Signature: `async def extract_excel(file_path: str) -> DocumentMetadata`
   - Location: raglite/ingestion/pipeline.py (new function to add)
   - Contract includes: input parameters, output structure, raised exceptions, implementation notes

2. **DocumentMetadata (existing model)** - Lines 234-243
   - Kind: Pydantic model
   - Purpose: Data structure for document ingestion results
   - Contract: Excel must populate filename, doc_type='Excel', ingestion_timestamp, page_count (sheet count), source_path

3. **get_logger (existing utility)** - Lines 244-254
   - Kind: function
   - Purpose: Get structured logger for module
   - Contract: Use with extra={'doc_filename', 'sheet_count', 'duration_ms'}, avoid 'filename' key (reserved)

**Quality Attributes:**
- ✓ Comprehensive contract definitions (inputs, outputs, exceptions)
- ✓ Implementation notes included (specific library usage patterns)
- ✓ Clear distinction between new and existing interfaces

**Sample Interface Contract (extract_excel, lines 217-222):**
```xml
<contract>
  <input>file_path: str (absolute or relative path to .xlsx or .xls file)</input>
  <output>DocumentMetadata with filename, doc_type='Excel', page_count=sheet_count, ingestion_timestamp, source_path</output>
  <raises>FileNotFoundError: If Excel file doesn't exist at specified path</raises>
  <raises>RuntimeError: If openpyxl parsing fails, password-protected file, or corrupted file</raises>
</contract>
```

**Assessment:** Interface definitions are exceptionally detailed and developer-ready. The extract_excel interface includes not only the contract but also implementation notes with specific library calls (openpyxl.load_workbook, pd.DataFrame, df.to_markdown). This level of detail significantly accelerates implementation while ensuring consistency with existing patterns.

### ✓ Item 7: Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns

**Status:** PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 183-208

**Constraint Count:** 6 constraints across 5 types

**Constraints:**

1. **Architecture Constraint** (lines 184-187)
   - Rule: Extend existing raglite/ingestion/pipeline.py (DO NOT create new file)
   - Rationale: Maintains monolithic architecture, line count budget 180 lines (130 current + 50 Excel)

2. **Pattern Constraint** (lines 188-191)
   - Rule: Follow Story 1.2 patterns EXACTLY (async, type hints, docstrings, structured logging, error handling)
   - Rationale: Proven patterns with 100% test coverage and QA approval

3. **Technology Constraint** (lines 192-195)
   - Rule: ONLY openpyxl + pandas (locked tech stack)
   - Rationale: Architecture constraint from 5-technology-stack-definitive.md

4. **Source Attribution Constraint** (lines 196-199)
   - Rule: Extract and validate sheet_number != None (NFR7: 95%+ attribution accuracy)
   - Rationale: Required for citation format with sheet numbers

5. **Testing Constraint** (lines 200-203)
   - Rule: 7 unit tests + 1 integration test (80%+ coverage, mocked dependencies, @pytest.mark.slow)
   - Rationale: Maintains Story 1.2 testing standards

6. **Logging Constraint** (lines 204-208)
   - Rule: Structured logging with extra={}, avoid 'filename' key (use 'doc_filename')
   - Rationale: Lesson learned from Story 1.2 ('filename' reserved by LogRecord)

**Quality Attributes:**
- ✓ Each constraint has type classification
- ✓ Clear rule statement
- ✓ Business/technical rationale provided
- ✓ Includes lessons learned (logging constraint)

**Sample Constraint (Testing, lines 200-203):**
```xml
<constraint type="testing">
  <rule>7 unit tests + 1 integration test pattern (same as Story 1.2). Target: 80%+ coverage for Excel extraction path. Mock openpyxl/pandas in unit tests. Integration test with @pytest.mark.slow.</rule>
  <rationale>Maintains testing standards from Story 1.2. Fast unit tests (<12s) with mocks, slow integration test (>5s) with real Excel file.</rationale>
</constraint>
```

**Assessment:** Constraints are comprehensive and enforce critical architectural principles. The inclusion of a "lessons learned" constraint (logging) demonstrates process maturity and prevents regression of known issues. All constraints are actionable and directly impact implementation decisions.

2. **pandas** >=2.0,<3.0 - DataFrame operations, markdown table generation
3. **pydantic** >=2.0,<3.0 - Data validation with DocumentMetadata, Chunk models

**Development Dependencies:**
4. **pytest** ==8.4.2 - Test framework
5. **pytest-asyncio** ==1.2.0 - Async test support for async def extract_excel()
6. **pytest-mock** >=3.12,<4.0 - Mocking openpyxl/pandas in unit tests
7. **pytest-xdist** >=3.5,<4.0 - Parallel test execution

**Quality Attributes:**
- ✓ Version constraints specified (semantic versioning)
- ✓ Group classification (dev vs production)
- ✓ Explicit reason for each dependency
- ✓ Aligned with locked technology stack

**Sample Dependency Entry (lines 172-173):**
```xml
<package name="openpyxl" version=">=3.1,<4.0" reason="Excel file parsing (.xlsx, .xls)" />
<package name="pandas" version=">=2.0,<3.0" reason="DataFrame operations, markdown table generation with df.to_markdown()" />
```

**Assessment:** Dependency list is complete and properly versioned. All dependencies align with the locked technology stack from 5-technology-stack-definitive.md. Version constraints follow best practices (semantic versioning with upper bounds to prevent breaking changes). The inclusion of test-specific dependencies (pytest-mock, pytest-asyncio) demonstrates thorough planning for the testing strategy.

### ✓ Item 9: Testing standards and locations populated

**Status:** PASS
**Evidence:** Lines 256-275

**Testing Documentation Sections:**

1. **Standards** (lines 257-259)
   - Testing pattern: 7 unit tests (mocked) + 1 integration test (real file, @pytest.mark.slow)
   - Coverage target: 80%+ for Excel extraction path
   - Execution time: Unit tests <12s total, integration test >5s
   - Tools: pytest-mock for openpyxl.load_workbook and pandas.DataFrame mocking

2. **Locations** (lines 260-264)
   - raglite/tests/test_ingestion.py (unit tests)
   - raglite/tests/test_ingestion_integration.py (integration tests)
   - raglite/tests/fixtures/sample_financial_data.xlsx (NEW test fixture to add)

3. **Test Ideas** (lines 265-274)
   - 8 test scenarios mapped to acceptance criteria
   - Each test includes: AC mapping, test name, description, validation points

**Sample Test Idea (lines 266):**
```xml
<idea ac="1,2">Test: test_extract_excel_success() - Happy path with valid multi-sheet Excel file. Mock openpyxl.load_workbook to return workbook with 3 sheets. Verify DocumentMetadata returned with doc_type='Excel', page_count=3, sheet metadata extracted.</idea>
```

**Test Coverage Matrix:**
- AC 1,2 → test_extract_excel_success
- AC 3 → test_extract_excel_multi_sheet
- AC 4 → test_extract_excel_numeric_formats
- AC 6 → test_extract_excel_file_not_found, test_extract_excel_password_protected, test_extract_excel_corrupted
- AC 7 → test_extract_excel_sheet_numbers
- AC 5,9 → test_extract_excel_integration

**Assessment:** Testing documentation is exceptionally thorough. Standards match proven patterns from Story 1.2. Test ideas provide clear implementation guidance with specific assertions to validate. The AC-to-test mapping ensures complete coverage of all acceptance criteria. Test locations are clearly specified, and the new test fixture requirement (sample_financial_data.xlsx) is explicitly called out.
