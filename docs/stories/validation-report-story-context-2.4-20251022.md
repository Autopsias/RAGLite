## Section Results

### Story Context Quality Assessment
**Pass Rate:** 10/10 (100%)

#### ✓ PASS - Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured
**Evidence:** Lines 13-15
```xml
<asA>a RAG system</asA>
<iWant>LLM-generated metadata (fiscal period, company, department)</iWant>
<soThat>queries can filter by business context and improve precision</soThat>
```
**Analysis:** All three story fields captured correctly from source story file. Clear user story format maintained.

---

#### ✓ PASS - Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention)
**Evidence:** Lines 26-36 (AC1-AC5 documented)
- AC1: GPT-5 nano API for metadata extraction (99.3% cost savings)

- AC3: Metadata Injection (Qdrant payload, filterable)
- AC4: Metadata Caching (<$0.0001 per document)
- AC5: Cost Validation ($0.00005 per document, 99.3% reduction)

**Analysis:** Exact match with Story 2.4 markdown file. Includes GPT-5 nano model swap details (changed from Claude 3.7 Sonnet). No fabrication or deviation from source.

---

---

#### ✓ PASS - Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable
**Evidence:** Lines 122-162 (4 interfaces documented)

   ```python
   async def extract_document_metadata(
       text: str,
       anthropic_client: AsyncAnthropic,
       cache: dict[str, DocumentMetadata]
   ) -> DocumentMetadata
   ```
   - Path: raglite/ingestion/pipeline.py (new function, ~50 lines)

2. **Chunk model (updated)** (Pydantic model)
   ```python
   class Chunk(BaseModel):
       # Existing fields: chunk_id, content, metadata, page_number, etc.
       # NEW fields for Story 2.4:
       fiscal_period: str | None = None
       company_name: str | None = None
       department_name: str | None = None
   ```
   - Path: raglite/shared/models.py (lines 23-49)

   ```python
   qdrant_client.upsert(collection_name: str, points: list[PointStruct])
   ```

4. **AsyncAnthropic.messages.create** (Anthropic SDK method)
   ```python
   await client.messages.create(model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", messages=[...])
   ```

**Analysis:** Critical interfaces well-documented with complete signatures. Covers new function to implement, model updates, and external SDK methods. Provides clear implementation contract.

---

#### ✓ PASS - Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns
**Evidence:** Lines 113-120 (6 constraints listed)

1. **KISS Principle:** No custom base classes, factories, or abstractions. Direct SDK usage only.
2. **No Custom Wrappers:** Use AsyncAnthropic EXACTLY as documented. NO wrapper classes.
3. **Code Size Target:** ~120 lines net addition (100 pipeline.py + 20 models.py). Total: ~600-800 lines.
4. **Accuracy Targets:** 68-72% (Story 2.3) → 70-75% (+2-3pp from metadata). ≥70% required.
5. **Table Accuracy Preservation:** Maintain 97.9% from Story 2.1. Metadata should NOT interfere.
6. **Testing Requirements:** 80%+ code coverage. Unit tests + integration tests (AC3, AC5).

**Analysis:** Comprehensive constraints aligned with CLAUDE.md anti-over-engineering rules. Includes code size, accuracy targets, backward compatibility, and testing standards. All actionable and measurable.

#### ✓ PASS - Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks
**Evidence:** Lines 101-110 (6 Python packages)

| Package | Version | Purpose |

**Analysis:** Complete dependency list from pyproject.toml. All include name, version, and purpose. Correctly identifies tiktoken as already installed. No missing dependencies.

---

#### ✓ PASS - Testing standards and locations populated
**Evidence:** Lines 164-179

**Standards (line 165):**
- Testing framework: pytest 8.4.2 with pytest-asyncio 1.2.0
- Target: 80%+ code coverage (pytest-cov)
- Unit tests in tests/unit/, integration tests in tests/integration/
- Async test functions with @pytest.mark.asyncio (auto mode enabled)
- Mock external APIs (Anthropic) with pytest-mock
- Use fixtures from conftest.py for shared setup
- Structured logging assertions: verify extra={} context fields
- Performance tests: validate <$0.10/doc cost budget in AC5

**Locations (lines 166-170):**
- tests/unit/ (unit tests for metadata extraction function)
- tests/integration/ (AC3 metadata injection, AC5 cost validation)
- tests/conftest.py (shared fixtures: qdrant_client, embedding_model, test PDFs)

**Test Ideas (lines 171-178):** 6 test ideas mapped to AC1-AC5
- AC1: Mock Claude API response, verify DocumentMetadata parsing
- AC1: Verify metadata extraction caching (cache hit prevents redundant call)
- AC2: Verify Chunk model accepts new metadata fields with backward compatibility
- AC3: Integration test - ingest PDF, verify metadata in Qdrant, query with filter
- AC4: Verify cache effectiveness (~99% cache hits for multi-chunk document)
- AC5: Track token usage and cost for 160-page PDF, assert <$0.10 per document

**Analysis:** Comprehensive testing guidance. Standards cover framework, coverage, mocking, and logging. Locations specify test directories. Test ideas provide concrete AC-mapped test scenarios.

---

#### ✓ PASS - XML structure follows story-context template format
**Evidence:** Lines 1-180 (complete XML structure validated)

**Structure Validation:**
- ✓ Root element: `<story-context id="..." v="1.0">` (line 1)
- ✓ `<metadata>` section with epicId, storyId, title, status, generatedAt, generator, sourceStoryPath (lines 2-10)
- ✓ `<story>` section with asA, iWant, soThat, tasks (lines 12-24)
- ✓ `<acceptanceCriteria>` section (lines 26-36)
- ✓ `<artifacts>` with docs, code, dependencies subsections (lines 38-111)
- ✓ `<constraints>` section (lines 113-120)
- ✓ `<interfaces>` section (lines 122-162)
- ✓ `<tests>` section with standards, locations, ideas (lines 164-179)
- ✓ Proper XML closing tag `</story-context>` (line 180)

**Analysis:** Perfect template adherence. All required sections present and properly structured. Valid XML format. Matches story-context template schema exactly.
