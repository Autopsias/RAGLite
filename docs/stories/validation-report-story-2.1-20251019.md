**Pass Rate: 2/2 (100%)**

#### ✓ PASS - Interfaces/API contracts extracted
**Evidence:** XML lines 193-220 include 3 fully documented interfaces:

**PdfiumBackend Interface:**
```xml
<signature>from docling.backend.pypdfium_backend import PdfiumBackend</signature>
<usage>Pass as backend parameter to PdfPipelineOptions: PdfPipelineOptions(do_table_structure=True, backend=PdfiumBackend)</usage>
```

**DocumentConverter Interface:**
```xml
<signature>DocumentConverter(format_options={InputFormat.PDF: PdfFormatOption(pipeline_options=pipeline_options)})</signature>
<usage>Configure with PdfFormatOption containing PdfPipelineOptions with pypdfium backend. Existing initialization at raglite/ingestion/pipeline.py:1016-1018.</usage>
```

**PdfPipelineOptions Interface:**
```xml
<signature>PdfPipelineOptions(do_table_structure: bool, backend: Type[Backend])</signature>
<usage>Current: PdfPipelineOptions(do_table_structure=True). New: Add backend=PdfiumBackend parameter. Preserve table_structure_options.mode = TableFormerMode.ACCURATE.</usage>
```

**Impact:** All Docling API contracts documented with signatures, usage patterns, and integration points. Developer has complete API reference.

#### ✓ PASS - Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns
**Evidence:** XML lines 178-191 include 6 constraint types with clear references:

1. **accuracy** - NFR9 compliance (97.9% table accuracy requirement)
2. **architecture** - No refactoring, only parameter addition
3. **async** - Preserve existing async patterns
4. **breaking-changes** - Backend switch must be transparent to downstream pipeline
5. **simplicity** - KISS principle, 15-line modification-only change (references CLAUDE.md rules)
6. **tech-stack** - pypdfium LOCKED and APPROVED (references 5-technology-stack-definitive.md)

**Impact:** All development constraints clearly stated with justification. Aligns with CLAUDE.md anti-over-engineering rules.

## Failed Items
**None** - No critical failures detected.

---

## Partial Items

### ⚠ Item 4: Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets
**What's Missing:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Referenced in constraints (line 188: "KISS principle per CLAUDE.md anti-over-engineering rules") but not included in artifacts
- `docs/architecture/3-repository-structure-monolithic.md` - File organization context for raglite/ingestion/ module
- `docs/architecture/6-complete-reference-implementation.md` - Coding patterns and style guide

**Why It Matters:**
- CLAUDE.md provides critical development rules (no abstractions, no wrappers, direct SDK usage)
- Section 3 provides file organization rationale
- Section 6 provides coding standards that apply to this story

**Recommendation:** Add 1-2 more architecture docs to reach 5-6 total documents for more comprehensive context.

---

## Additional Issues Found

### Minor Issue: Filename Reference in Story.md
**Location:** story.md line 176
**Current:** `[Story Context XML: docs/stories/story-context-2.2.1.xml]`
**Should Be:** `[Story Context XML: docs/stories/story-context-2.1.xml]`

**Impact:** Documentation reference outdated after file rename. Fix during story implementation.

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Should Improve (Priority: Low)
**Add 1-2 architecture documents to artifacts section** to reach optimal 5-7 document range:
- `CLAUDE.md` (development constraints - already referenced in line 188)
- `docs/architecture/6-complete-reference-implementation.md` (coding patterns)

**Benefit:** Provides complete development context in one XML file, reducing need for developer to hunt for referenced docs.

**Effort:** 10 minutes to add 2 doc entries with relevant snippets.

### 2. Consider (Priority: Very Low)
**Update story.md line 176** to correct filename reference after implementation begins.

**Benefit:** Documentation accuracy.

**Effort:** 1 minute edit.

- Perfect alignment with source story (no invention)
- Complete task breakdown (19 subtasks across 5 tasks)
- Precise code location references (line numbers + reasons)
- Comprehensive interface documentation (3 API contracts)
- Detailed testing roadmap (4 test scenarios)
- Clear constraints referencing architecture docs

**Minor Improvement Opportunity:**
- Add 1-2 more architecture docs to enhance context breadth (currently 4/5 minimum)

**Developer Readiness:** Story Context provides all necessary information for implementation. Developer can proceed without additional documentation research.
