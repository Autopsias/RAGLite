## Overview

The RAGLite test suite includes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests that interact with:
- Docling (PDF processing)
- Qdrant (vector database)
- Fin-E5 embedding models
- Claude API (mocked in most tests)

**Without optimization:** Tests run sequentially, taking 5-10+ minutes
**With optimization:** Tests run in parallel, taking 2-3 minutes (50-70% reduction)

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Parallel Test Execution (pytest-xdist)

**Configuration:** `pytest.ini`, `pyproject.toml`

```ini
addopts =
    -n auto              # Auto-detect CPU cores
    --dist loadfile      # Distribute by file for better load balancing
```

**Benefits:**
- 2-4x speedup for unit tests
- 1.5-3x speedup for integration tests
- Automatic CPU core detection

### 2. Fixture Scoping Optimization

**File:** `tests/conftest.py`

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="session")   # Created once per test session
def session_test_settings(): ...

@pytest.fixture(scope="module")    # Created once per test file
def mock_qdrant_client(): ...

@pytest.fixture                    # Created per test (default)
def sample_chunk(): ...
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces fixture creation overhead
- Session-scoped: Settings (created once)
- Module-scoped: Mock clients, sample data (created per file)
- Function-scoped: Mutable test data (created per test)

### 3. Test Execution Order Optimization

**Hook:** `pytest_collection_modifyitems` in `tests/conftest.py`

```python
# Tests run in order: unit → integration → slow/e2e
```

**Benefits:**
- Fast tests run first for quicker feedback
- Fail-fast behavior for unit tests
- Slower tests run last (can be interrupted)

### 4. Test Duration Monitoring

**Configuration:** `pytest.ini`

```ini
--durations=10          # Show 10 slowest tests
--durations-min=1.0     # Only show tests >1 second
```

**Benefits:**
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Track test performance over time
- Optimize slow tests

### 5. Performance Plugins

**New packages:** `pyproject.toml`

```toml
pytest-instafail    # Show failures immediately (don't wait for suite to finish)
pytest-sugar        # Better progress output with real-time feedback
pytest-benchmark    # Performance benchmarking for critical paths
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Performance Dependencies

```bash
# Install all dev dependencies including performance plugins
make install-dev

# Or using uv directly
uv sync --group dev --group test
```

### 2. Run Tests with Parallel Execution

```bash
# Run all tests in parallel (default)
make test

# Run unit tests only (fastest)
make test-fast

# Run integration tests
make test-integration
```

### 3. VSCode Test Explorer

**Already configured!** The `.vscode/settings.json` file includes parallel execution settings.

Simply:
1. Open VSCode Test Explorer
2. Click "Run All Tests"
3. Tests will automatically run in parallel

## Makefile Commands

### Fast Development Workflows

```bash
make test-fast        # Unit tests only, exit on first failure (TDD)
make dev-test         # Clean + fast tests (ideal for development)
make test-failed      # Rerun only failed tests
```

### Full Test Runs

```bash
make test             # All tests in parallel (default)
make test-unit        # Unit tests with coverage
make test-integration # Integration tests only
make test-slow        # Slow/e2e tests only
```

### Coverage & Reports

```bash
make test-coverage    # Full coverage report (HTML + terminal)
make test-nocov       # Skip coverage for faster runs
make ci-test          # Run as CI would (coverage + JUnit XML)
```

### Performance Analysis

```bash
make test-profile     # Show 50 slowest tests
make perf-report      # Generate full performance report
make test-debug       # Verbose output, no parallelization
```

### Debugging

```bash
make test-sequential  # Run tests one-by-one (easier to debug)
make test-debug       # Verbose output with full tracebacks
```

### Cleanup

```bash
make clean-test       # Remove .pytest_cache, coverage files, __pycache__
```

## VSCode Test Explorer

### Configuration

File: `.vscode/settings.json`

```jsonc
{
  "python.testing.pytestArgs": [
    "tests",
    "-n", "auto",           // Parallel execution
    "--dist", "loadfile",   // Load balancing
    "--durations=10"        // Show slow tests
  ]
}
```

### Tips

1. **Faster feedback:** Disable coverage during development
   - Comment out `--cov` flags in `.vscode/settings.json`
   - Re-enable before committing

2. **Run specific tests:**
   - Right-click test → "Run Test"
   - Use Test Explorer filters (passed/failed/skipped)

3. **Debug tests:**
   - Right-click test → "Debug Test"
   - Parallel execution is automatically disabled in debug mode

## Configuration Details

### pytest.ini

```ini
[pytest]
# Parallel execution
addopts =
    -n auto              # Use all CPU cores
    --dist loadfile      # Distribute tests by file
    --durations=10       # Show 10 slowest tests
    --reuse-db          # Reuse database connections

# Test markers
markers =
    unit: Unit tests (fast, no external dependencies)
    integration: Integration tests (require Qdrant)
    slow: Slow tests (>5 seconds)
    e2e: End-to-end tests
```

### pyproject.toml

```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
asyncio_mode = "auto"  # Auto-detect async tests

[dependency-groups]
dev = [
    "pytest-xdist",      # Parallel execution
    "pytest-instafail",  # Show failures immediately
    "pytest-sugar",      # Better output
    "pytest-benchmark",  # Performance benchmarking
]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tests fail in parallel but pass sequentially

**Cause:** Test isolation issues (shared state, race conditions)

**Solutions:**
1. Use proper fixture scoping
2. Ensure test data is unique (use timestamps, UUIDs)
3. Mock external dependencies
4. Use `@pytest.mark.serial` for tests that must run sequentially

**Example:**
```python
# Integration tests use unique collection names
test_collection = f"test_storage_{int(time.time())}"
```

### Issue: Qdrant connection errors in parallel tests

**Cause:** Multiple workers connecting simultaneously

**Solutions:**
1. Use unique collection names per test
2. Implement connection pooling
3. Add retry logic for connection errors
4. Reduce worker count: `pytest -n 4` instead of `-n auto`

### Issue: Tests are still slow

**Debug steps:**
1. Identify slow tests: `make test-profile`
2. Check if mocking is effective: `tests/unit/` should have no real API calls
3. Verify parallel execution: Look for `[gw0]`, `[gw1]`, etc. in test output
4. Review fixture scoping: Ensure expensive fixtures are module/session-scoped

**Common bottlenecks:**
- PDF processing with Docling (use sample PDFs, not full documents)
- Embedding generation (mock in unit tests, use small batches in integration tests)
- Qdrant operations (use batch operations, unique collections)

### Issue: VSCode Test Explorer doesn't show parallel execution

**Solutions:**
1. Reload VSCode: `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Reload Window"
2. Clear pytest cache: `make clean-test`
3. Verify settings: Check `.vscode/settings.json` has `-n auto`
4. Check Python interpreter: Ensure correct virtual environment is selected

### Issue: Coverage reports are incomplete with parallel execution

**Cause:** Coverage data not merged across workers

**Solution:** pytest-cov handles this automatically, but verify:
```bash
# Should see coverage data from all workers
make test-coverage
```

If coverage is still missing:
```bash
# Clean and retry
make clean-test test-coverage
```

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Performance (Example Test Suite)

| Test Category | Sequential | Parallel (-n auto) | Speedup |
|---------------|------------|-------------------|---------|
| Unit tests (50) | 30s | 8s | 3.75x |
| Integration tests (20) | 180s (3m) | 75s (1.25m) | 2.4x |
| E2E tests (10) | 300s (5m) | 120s (2m) | 2.5x |
| **Total** | **510s (8.5m)** | **203s (3.4m)** | **2.5x** |

### CPU Core Impact

| CPU Cores | Test Time | Workers |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 4 cores   | ~200s     | 4       |
| 8 cores   | ~150s     | 8       |
| 16 cores  | ~120s     | 16      |

*Note: Diminishing returns beyond 8 cores due to I/O bottlenecks (Qdrant, disk)*

## Best Practices

### 1. Write Parallel-Safe Tests

```python
# ✅ GOOD: Unique test data
test_collection = f"test_{uuid.uuid4()}"

# ❌ BAD: Shared collection name
test_collection = "test_collection"
```

### 2. Use Appropriate Markers

```python
@pytest.mark.unit          # Fast unit tests
@pytest.mark.integration   # Requires external services
@pytest.mark.slow          # >5 seconds
@pytest.mark.e2e           # Full end-to-end workflow
```

### 3. Mock External Dependencies in Unit Tests

```python
# Unit tests should mock Qdrant, Claude API, etc.
def test_search(mock_qdrant_client):
    mock_qdrant_client.search.return_value = [...]
    # Test logic
```

### 4. Use Session/Module-Scoped Fixtures for Expensive Operations

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def embedding_model():
    # Load model once for entire session
    return load_model()
```

### 5. Run Fast Tests During Development

```bash
# During development (TDD)
make test-fast

# Before committing
make test-coverage

# CI pipeline
make ci-test
```

## Further Optimization Ideas

1. **Pytest-watch:** Auto-rerun tests on file changes
   ```bash
   pip install pytest-watch
   make test-watch
   ```

2. **Test sharding (CI):** Split tests across multiple CI jobs
   ```bash
   # Job 1: Unit tests
   pytest -m unit

   # Job 2: Integration tests
   pytest -m integration
   ```

3. **Docker for Qdrant:** Use Docker Compose for consistent test environment
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d qdrant
   make test-integration
   ```

4. **Test data fixtures:** Pre-generate test PDFs and embeddings
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
   def sample_embeddings():
       # Generate once, reuse everywhere
       return np.load("tests/fixtures/sample_embeddings.npy")
   ```
