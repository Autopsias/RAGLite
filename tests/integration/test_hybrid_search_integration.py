"""Integration tests for hybrid search (BM25 + semantic) - Story 2.1.

Tests hybrid search against real Qdrant data and ground truth queries.
Validates accuracy improvements over semantic-only baseline.

Success Criteria (from Story 2.1):
- Retrieval accuracy ≥70% (baseline 56%, target 71-76%)
- Attribution accuracy ≥45% (baseline 32%, target improvement)
- p95 latency <10,000ms (NFR13 compliance)

Usage:
    # Run all hybrid search integration tests
    pytest tests/integration/test_hybrid_search_integration.py -v

    # Run specific test
    pytest tests/integration/test_hybrid_search_integration.py::TestHybridSearchIntegration::test_hybrid_search_exact_numbers -v

Performance Optimization:
- Lazy imports: Expensive modules (raglite.retrieval.*) imported inside test functions
  to avoid 6+ second import overhead during test discovery (critical for test explorers)
