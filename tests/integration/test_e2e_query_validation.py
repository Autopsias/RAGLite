"""End-to-end query validation tests for Story 1.10.

This module validates the natural language query tool (query_financial_documents)

  - Financial terminology handling (EBITDA, gross margin, OpEx, etc.)
  - Metadata completeness validation
  - Ground truth test set validation
  - End-to-end integration testing
  - Performance measurement (p50/p95 latency)

Target Metrics (Week 2 baseline):
  - Retrieval accuracy: ≥70% (path to 90%+ by Week 5)
  - Query latency: p50 <5s, p95 <10s
  - Metadata completeness: 100% (page_number != None)

Week 0 Baseline (for comparison):

  - Avg query latency: 0.83s
  - Avg semantic score: 0.84
