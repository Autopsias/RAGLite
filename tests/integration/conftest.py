    This session-scoped fixture uses the 10-page sample PDF for fast local testing.
    Tests that require the full 160-page PDF should use @pytest.mark.skipif.

    The fixture:
    1. CLEARS any existing Qdrant data to ensure clean state
    2. Uses ONLY the 10-page sample PDF (fast: ~8 seconds)
    3. Ingests PDF into Qdrant (creates collection if needed)
    4. Makes data available for all integration tests
